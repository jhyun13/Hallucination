This group lies in the s - block of the periodic table of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s - orbital : this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties . Indeed , the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table , with elements exhibiting well - characterised homologous behaviour . The alkali metals are all shiny , soft , highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge + 1 . They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness , exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen ( and in the case of lithium , nitrogen ) . Because of their high reactivity , they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air , and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements . Caesium , the fifth alkali metal , is the most reactive of all the metals . In the modern IUPAC nomenclature , the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements , excluding hydrogen ( H ) , which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals . All the alkali metals react with water , with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones . All of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds : in order of abundance , sodium is the most abundant , followed by potassium , lithium , rubidium , caesium , and finally francium , which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity ; francium occurs only in the minutest traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains . Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium ( Uue ) , which is likely to be the next member of the group , but they have all met with failure . However , ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects , which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements ; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal , it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues . Most alkali metals have many different applications . One of the best - known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in atomic clocks , of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time . A common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium - vapour lamp , which emits light very efficiently . Table salt , or sodium chloride , has been used since antiquity . Sodium and potassium are also essential elements , having major biological roles as electrolytes , and although the other alkali metals are not essential , they also have various effects on the body , both beneficial and harmful .

Hence , all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities , melting and boiling points , as well as heats of sublimation , vaporisation , and dissociation . They all crystallise in the body - centered cubic crystal structure , and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited . The ns configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii , as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity . Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s - orbital to form the + 1 oxidation state , due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy . Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group . The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity ; thus , the presentation of its properties here is limited . What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium , as expected . The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed ; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations .

The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other . Indeed , the similarity is so great that it is quite difficult to separate potassium , rubidium , and caesium , due to their similar ionic radii ; lithium and sodium are more distinct . For instance , when moving down the table , all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius , decreasing electronegativity , increasing reactivity , and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation . In general , their densities increase when moving down the table , with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium . One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials : lithium 's value is anomalous , being more negative than the others . This is because the Li ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase : though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly , causing a higher change in entropy , this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal , despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase . The stable alkali metals are all silver - coloured metals except for caesium , which has a pale golden tint : it is one of only three metals that are clearly coloured ( the other two being copper and gold ) . Additionally , the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium , strontium , and barium , as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium , are pale yellow , though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium . Their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation . They all crystallise in the body - centered cubic crystal structure , and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited . Indeed , these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble . Play media Potassium reacts violently with water at room temperature Play media Caesium reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures All the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature . Because of this , they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene ( paraffin oil ) . They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides , which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride ( Li F ) . The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care . The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones ; for example , when dropped into water , caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if the same number of moles of each metal is used . The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron . Not only do the alkali metals react with water , but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols , gaseous ammonia , and alkynes , the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity . Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides . The second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus ; thus , they almost always lose a single electron , forming cations . The alkalides are an exception : they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a − 1 oxidation state , which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides , the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form anions and were thought to be able to appear in salts only as cations . The alkalide anions have filled s - subshells , which gives them enough stability to exist . All the stable alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides , and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation potentials . Alkalides are chemically similar to the electrides , which are salts with trapped electrons acting as anions . A particularly striking example of an alkalide is `` inverse sodium hydride "

The authoritarian new mayor of Megasaki City , Kobayashi , signs a decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island , despite a scientist named Professor Watanabe insisting he is close to finding a cure . The first dog to be banished is Spots , who belonged to Atari Kobayashi , the orphaned nephew and ward of the mayor . Six months later , Atari runs away from home , steals a plane and flies to Trash Island to find Spots . After a crash - landing , he is rescued by five dogs : Rex , King , Duke , Boss , and Chief . They decide to help Atari locate Spots , although Chief , a former stray , is reluctant to fraternize with humans . Initially believing he died months ago after his cage failed to open upon arrival , the dogs soon learn there was a mixup and Spots may be alive elsewhere on the island . After a skirmish with a rescue team sent by Kobayashi to retrieve Atari , and at the insistence of a female purebreed named Nutmeg , Chief has a change of heart and decides to accompany Atari and company on their search . They seek advice from two sage dogs Jupiter and Oracle , who inform them of a rumored cannibal tribe of dogs on an isolated part of the island . Meanwhile , Professor Watanabe finds a cure , but is poisoned by Mayor Kobayashi to prevent the dogs from being returned from Trash Island . Foreign exchange student Tracy Walker suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate . Ultimately , she confronts assistant scientist Yoko Ono , a former cohort of Watanabe , who confirms Tracy 's suspicions and gives her the last remaining dose of the cure . During the journey , Atari and Chief are separated from the others . Atari bathes Chief , which reveals that his coat is actually white with dark spots , having become dirtied due to his time as a stray . Noticing the similarity between Chief and Spots ' appearances , Atari realises that Chief is of Spots ' breed , which is extremely rare . Chief recalls being part of a litter , where most of his siblings died , save for one . This implies that Chief may be Spots ' brother . Chief reveals he was once a house pet , forced to flee after regretfully attacking his master out of fear . Chief begins to bond with Atari as they continue their journey alone together , with Chief beginning to open and care for Atari . They rejoin the group and locate the isolated , so - called ' cannibal ' , tribe of dogs , but find themselves ambushed by Kobayashi 's men once again . Spots arrives with a small army of dogs who help fend off the assailants . Through flashbacks , he reveals that he was rescued upon arrival by the ' cannibal ' tribe and later became their leader . Spots also confirms that Chief is his brother and asks to transfer his protection duties for Atari to Chief , and both agree . An owl arrives , revealing that Kobayashi plans to order total extermination of all dogs on Trash Island upon his imminent re-election . Atari and many of the island dog tribe decide to return to Megasaki City to attempt to prevent this . At Kobayashi 's election ceremony , he prepares to give the order , but Tracy presents her evidence of his corruption and the cure 's existence . Atari and the dogs also arrive and confirm the cure works . Kobayashi has a change of heart , but his right - hand man Major Domo insists upon seeing the extermination through . A fight ensues in which the ' execute ' button is pressed , but , instead , the poison backfires on the captors , thanks to a hacker friend of Tracy 's , allowing the island dogs to escape death . During the fight , Atari and Spots are gravely injured . Atari 's only remaining kidney fails , but Kobayashi , admitting his mistakes , donates his own to save the boy . By election law , mayorship of the city falls to Atari and he decrees that dogs be allowed to reintegrate into society . Tracy and Atari become a couple , and Chief reunites with Nutmeg and takes up the role of bodyguard for Atari . Presumed dead , Spots recovers from his injuries and secretly raises his children under the Kobayashi Manor .

The water moves from one reservoir to another , such as from river to ocean , or from the ocean to the atmosphere , by the physical processes of evaporation , condensation , precipitation , infiltration , surface runoff , and subsurface flow .

Play media Water vapor is converted to clouds that bring fresh water to land in the form of rain snow and sleet Play media Precipitation falls on the ground , but what happens to that water depends greatly on the geography of the land at any particular place . The water cycle , also known as the hydrological cycle or the hydrologic cycle , describes the continuous movement of water on , above and below the surface of the Earth .

In doing so , the water goes through different forms : liquid , solid ( ice ) and vapor . The water cycle involves the exchange of energy , which leads to temperature changes . When water evaporates , it takes up energy from its surroundings and cools the environment . When it condenses , it releases energy and warms the environment . These heat exchanges influence climate . The evaporative phase of the cycle purifies water which then replenishes the land with freshwater . The flow of liquid water and ice transports minerals across the globe . It is also involved in reshaping the geological features of the Earth , through processes including erosion and sedimentation . The water cycle is also essential for the maintenance of most life and ecosystems on the planet .

Water evaporates as water vapor into the air . Some ice and snow sublimates directly into water vapor . Evapotranspiration is water transpired from plants and evaporated from the soil . The water molecule H O has smaller molecular mass than the major components of the atmosphere , nitrogen and oxygen , N and O , hence is less dense . Due to the significant difference in density , buoyancy drives humid air higher . As altitude increases , air pressure decreases and the temperature drops ( see Gas laws ) . The lower temperature causes water vapor to condense into tiny liquid water droplets which are heavier than the air , and fall unless supported by an updraft . A huge concentration of these droplets over a large space up in the atmosphere become visible as cloud . Some condensation is near ground level , and called fog . Atmospheric circulation moves water vapor around the globe , cloud particles collide , grow , and fall out of the upper atmospheric layers as precipitation . Some precipitation falls as snow or hail , sleet , and can accumulate as ice cap s and glacier s , which can store frozen water for thousands of years . Most water falls back into the oceans or onto land as rain , where the water flows over the ground as surface runoff . A portion of runoff enters rivers in valleys in the landscape , with streamflow moving water towards the oceans . Runoff and water emerging from the ground ( groundwater ) may be stored as freshwater in lakes . Not all runoff flows into rivers , much of it soaks into the ground as infiltration . Some water infiltrates deep into the ground and replenishes aquifers , which can store freshwater for long periods of time . Some infiltration stays close to the land surface and can seep back into surface - water bodies ( and the ocean ) as groundwater discharge . Some groundwater finds openings in the land surface and comes out as freshwater springs . In river valleys and floodplains , there is often continuous water exchange between surface water and ground water in the hyporheic zone . Over time , the water returns to the ocean , to continue the water cycle . Processes Many different processes lead to movements and phase changes in water Precipitation Condensed water vapor that falls to the Earth 's surface . Most precipitation occurs as rain , but also includes snow , hail , fog drip , graupel , and sleet . Approximately 505,000 km ( 121,000 cu mi ) of water falls as precipitation each year , 398,000 km ( 95,000 cu mi ) of it over the oceans . The rain on land contains 107,000 km ( 26,000 cu mi ) of water per year and a snowing only 1,000 km ( 240 cu mi ) . 78 % of global precipitation occurs over the ocean . Canopy interception The precipitation that is intercepted by plant foliage eventually evaporates back to the atmosphere rather than falling to the ground . Snowmelt The runoff produced by melting snow . Runoff The variety of ways by which water moves across the land . This includes both surface runoff and channel runoff . As it flows , the water may seep into the ground , evaporate into the air , become stored in lakes or reservoirs , or be extracted for agricultural or other human uses . Infiltration The flow of water from the ground surface into the ground . Once infiltrated , the water becomes soil moisture or groundwater . A recent global study using water stable isotopes , however , shows that not all soil moisture is equally available for groundwater recharge or for plant transpiration . Subsurface flow The flow of water underground , in the vadose zone and aquifers . Subsurface water may return to the surface ( e.g. as a spring or by being pumped ) or eventually seep into the oceans . Water returns to the land surface at lower elevation than where it infiltrated , under the force of gravity or gravity induced pressures . Groundwater tends to move slowly and is replenished slowly , so it can remain in aquifers for thousands of years . Evaporation The transformation of water from liquid to gas phases as it moves from the ground or bodies of water into the overlying atmosphere . The source of energy for evaporation is primarily solar radiation . Evaporation often implicitly includes transpiration from plants , though together they are specifically referred to as evapotranspiration . Total annual evapotranspiration amounts to approximately 505,000 km ( 121,000 cu mi ) of water , 434,000 km ( 104,000 cu mi ) of which evaporates from the oceans . 86 % of global evaporation occurs over the ocean . Sublimation The state change directly from solid water ( snow or ice ) to water vapor by passing the liquid state . Deposition This refers to changing of water vapor directly to ice . Advection The movement of water through the atmosphere . Without advection , water that evaporated over the oceans could not precipitate over land . Condensation The transformation of water vapor to liquid water droplets in the air , creating clouds and fog . Transpiration The release of water vapor from plants and soil into the air . Percolation Water flows vertically through the soil and rocks under the influence of gravity . Plate tectonics Water enters the mantle via subduction of oceanic crust . Water returns to the surface via volcanism . The water cycle involves many of these processes . Residence times Average reservoir residence times Reservoir Average residence time Antarctica 20,000 years Oceans 3,200 years Glaciers 20 to 100 years Seasonal snow cover 2 to 6 months Soil moisture 1 to 2 months Groundwater : shallow 100 to 200 years Groundwater : deep 10,000 years Lakes ( see lake retention time ) 50 to 100 years Rivers 2 to 6 months Atmosphere 9 days The residence time of a reservoir within the hydrologic cycle is the average time a water molecule will spend in that reservoir ( see adjacent table ) . It is a measure of the average age of the water in that reservoir . Groundwater can spend over 10,000 years beneath Earth 's surface before leaving . Particularly old groundwater is called fossil water . Water stored in the soil remains there very briefly , because it is spread thinly across the Earth , and is readily lost by evaporation , transpiration , stream flow , or groundwater recharge . After evaporating , the residence time in the atmosphere is about 9 days before condensing and falling to the Earth as precipitation . The major ice sheets - Antarctica and Greenland - store ice for very long periods . Ice from Antarctica has been reliably dated to 800,000 years before present , though the average residence time is shorter . In hydrology , residence times can be estimated in two ways . The more common method relies on the principle of conservation of mass and assumes the amount of water in a given reservoir is roughly constant . With this method , residence times are estimated by dividing the volume of the reservoir by the rate by which water either enters or exits the reservoir . Conceptually , this is equivalent to timing how long it would take the reservoir to become filled from empty if no water were to leave ( or how long it would take the reservoir to empty from full if no water were to enter ) . An alternative method to estimate residence times , which is gaining in popularity for dating groundwater , is the use of isotopic techniques . This is done in the subfield of isotope hydrology . Changes over time Time - mean precipitation and evaporation as a function of latitude as simulated by an aqua - planet version of an atmospheric GCM ( GFDL 's AM2. 1 ) with a homogeneous `` slab - ocean "

The music was composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ( his opus 66 ) . The score was completed in 1889 , and is the second of his three ballets . The original scenario was conceived by Ivan Vsevolozhsky , and is based on Charles Perrault 's La Belle au bois dormant . The choreographer of the original production was Marius Petipa . The premiere performance took place at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on January 15 , 1890 . The work has become one of the classical repertoire 's most famous ballets .

It was later decided that Charles Perrault 's La Belle au bois dormant would be the story for which Tchaikovsky would compose the music for the ballet . Tchaikovsky did not hesitate to accept the commission , although he was aware that his only previous ballet , Swan Lake , met with little enthusiasm at that stage of his career . The ballet scenario that Tchaikovsky worked on was based on the Brothers Grimm 's version of Perrault 's work entitled ' Dornröschen ' . In that version , the Princess 's parents ( the King and the Queen ) survived the 100 - year sleep to celebrate the Princess 's wedding to the Prince . However , Vsevolozhsky incorporated Perrault 's other characters from his stories into the ballet , such as Puss in Boots , Little Red Riding Hood , Cinderella , Bluebird , Bluebeard , Ricky of the Tuft and Tom Thumb . Other French fairy tale characters to be featured are Beauty and the Beast , Pretty Goldilocks and The White Cat . Regardless , Tchaikovsky was happy to inform the Director of the Imperial Theatre that he had great pleasure studying the work and had come away with adequate inspiration to do it justice . The choreographer was Marius Petipa , ballet master of the Imperial Ballet , who wrote a very detailed list of instructions as to the musical requirements . Tchaikovsky worked quickly on the new work at Frolovskoye ; he began initial sketches in the winter of 1888 and began orchestration on the work on 30 May 1889 .

Background ( edit ) Following Imperial Japan 's victory in the Russo - Japanese War , with its subsequent withdrawal of Russian influence , and the Taft -- Katsura Agreement , in which the United States allegedly agreed not to interfere with Japan in matters concerning Korea , the Japanese government sought to formalize its sphere of influence over the Korean Peninsula . Delegates of both Empires met in Seoul to resolve differences in matters pertaining to Korea 's future foreign policy ; however , with the Korean Imperial palace under occupation by Japanese troops , and the Imperial Japanese Army stationed at strategic locations throughout Korea , the Korean side was at a distinct disadvantage in the discussions . Formation of treaty ( edit ) Jungmyeongjeon Hall , where the treaty was signed On 9 November 1905 , Itō Hirobumi arrived in Hanseong and gave a letter from the Emperor of Japan to Gojong , Emperor of Korea , asking him to sign the treaty . On 15 November 1905 , he ordered Japanese troops to encircle the Korean imperial palace and threatened the emperor in order to force him to agree to the treaty . On 17 November 1905 , Ito and Japanese Field Marshal Hasegawa Yoshimichi entered the Jungmyeongjeon Hall , a Russian - designed building that was once part of Deoksu Palace , to persuade Gojong to agree , but he refused . Ito pressured the cabinet with the implied , and later stated , threat of bodily harm , to sign the treaty . According to 한계옥 ( Han - Gyeok ) , Korean prime minister Han Gyu - seol disagreed , shouting loudly . Ito ordered the guards to lock him in a room and said if he continued screaming , they could kill him . The Korean cabinet signed an agreement that had been prepared by Ito in the Jungmyeongjeon . The Agreement gave Imperial Japan complete responsibility for Korea 's foreign affairs , and placed all trade through Korean ports under Imperial Japanese supervision . Treaty provisions ( edit ) This treaty deprived Korea of its diplomatic sovereignty , in effect making Korea a protectorate of Imperial Japan . The provisions of the treaty took effect on November 17 , 1905 , and it laid the foundation for the Japan -- Korea Treaty of 1907 , and subsequent annexation of Korea in 1910 . The treaty was deemed to have gone into effect after it received the signature of five Korean ministers : Minister of Education Lee Wan - yong ( 이완용 ; 李 完 用 ) Minister of Army Yi Geun - taek ( 이근택 ; 李根澤 ) Minister of Interior Yi Ji - yong ( 이지용 ; 李 址 鎔 ) Minister of Foreign Affairs Park Je - sun ( 박제순 ; 朴齊純 ) Minister of Agriculture , Commerce and Industry Gwon Jung - hyeon ( 권중현 ; 權重 顯 ) Emperor Gojong of Korea did not assent or sign the treaty . Other officials who disputed the treaty included : Prime Minister Han Gyu - seol ( 한규설 ; 韓圭卨 ) Minister of Finance Min Yeong - gi ( 민영기 ; 閔泳綺 ) Minister of Justice Yi Ha - yeong ( 이하영 ; 李夏榮 , Later , however , he turned from opposing to agreeing to the treaty ) Controversy ( edit ) Gojong 's analysis of the `` treaty of 1905 "
19,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy featured a cast of talented actors, including Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins, Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee, Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took, Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Orlando Bloom as Legolas.","Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins : a young hobbit who inherits the One Ring from his uncle Bilbo . Wood was the first actor to be cast on 7 July 1999 . Wood was a fan of the book , and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo , reading lines from the novel . Wood was selected from 150 actors who auditioned , including Jake Gyllenhaal . Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey : an Istari wizard and mentor to Frodo . Sean Connery was approached for the role , but did not understand the plot , while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script . Before being cast , McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two - month overlap with X-Men . He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films , and based his accent on Tolkien . Unlike his on - screen character , McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits ; instead he worked with their scale doubles . Sean Astin as Samwise `` Sam '' Gamgee : a hobbit gardener and Frodo 's best friend . Astin , who had recently become a father , bonded with the 18 - year - old Wood in a protective manner , which mirrored Sam 's relationship with Frodo .

Mortensen 's son , a fan of the book , convinced him to take the role . Mortensen read the book on the plane , received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop . Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume and carrying his `` hero '' sword around with him off - camera . Billy Boyd as Peregrin `` Pippin '' Took : a hobbit who travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor . Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc `` Merry '' Brandybuck : a distant cousin of Frodo . Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo .

Billy Connolly , who was considered for the part of Gimli , later portrayed Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson 's The Hobbit film trilogy . Rhys - Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli , which limited his vision , and eventually developed eczema around his eyes . Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf : a prince of the elves ' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer . Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir , who appears in the second film , a role which went to David Wenham . Sean Bean as Boromir : a prince of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor . Bruce Willis , a fan of the book , expressed interest in the role , while Liam Neeson was sent the script , but passed . Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins : Frodo 's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell .

Liv Tyler as Arwen Undomiel : a beautiful half - elf princess of Rivendell and Aragorn 's lover . The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in Plunkett & Macleane , and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film . Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role . Peter Jackson wanted to cast Uma Thurman as Arwen , but Thurman pulled out due to pregnancy , Tyler came to shoot on short occasions , unlike the rest of the actors . She was one of the last actors to be cast , on 25 August 1999 . Cate Blanchett as Galadriel : the elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside her husband Celeborn . Peter Jackson wanted to cast Lucy Lawless as Galadriel , but she declined due to pregnancy . Christopher Lee as Saruman the White : the fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron 's will through his use of the palantír. Lee was a major fan of the book , and read it once a year . He had also met J.R.R. Tolkien . He originally auditioned for Gandalf , but was judged too old . Hugo Weaving as Elrond : the elven Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond , which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring . David Bowie expressed interest in the role , but Jackson stated , `` To have a famous , beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable .

The teams of the member nations of FIFA , football 's world governing body , are ranked based on their game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest . The rankings were introduced in December 1992 , and eight teams ( Argentina , Belgium , Brazil , France , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands and Spain ) have held the top position , of which Brazil have spent longest ranked first . A points system is used , with points being awarded based on the results of all FIFA - recognised full international matches . Under the existing system , rankings are based on a team 's performance over the last four years , with more recent results and more significant matches being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team . The ranking system was most recently revamped after the 2006 World Cup , with the first edition of the new series of rankings issued on 12 July 2006 . The most significant change is that the rankings are now based on results over the previous four years instead of the previous eight years . The change is perceived to respond to criticisms that the FIFA World Rankings , based upon the previous calculation method in use from January 1999 to June 2006 , did not effectively reflect the relative strengths of the national teams . Alternative systems have been devised , such as the World Football Elo Ratings , based on the Elo rating system used in chess and Go , ranking teams . In September 2017 , FIFA announced they were reviewing the ranking system and will decide after the end of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification if any changes are to be made to improve the ranking .

First , that host teams rarely qualify for the Super Bowl during the year their city will host . Second , that teams rarely win consecutive Super Bowls .

The term has been used since at least 1992 , when The Washington Post used the term in print .

Together they compose the legislature of the United States . The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of Representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all Representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty - three representatives . Seven states have the smallest delegation possible , a single representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming . The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the President for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers which include the power to initiate all bills related to revenue , the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial before the Senate , and in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for President , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose . The presiding officer is the Speaker of the House , who is elected by the members thereof and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party .

See Foreign exchange derivative . The foreign exchange options market is the deepest , largest and most liquid market for options of any kind . Most trading is over the counter ( OTC ) and is lightly regulated , but a fraction is traded on exchanges like the International Securities Exchange , Philadelphia Stock Exchange , or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for options on futures contracts . The global market for exchange - traded currency options was notionally valued by the Bank for International Settlements at $158.3 trillion in 2005 . Contents ( hide ) 1 Example 2 Terms 3 Trading 4 Hedging 5 Valuation : the Garman -- Kohlhagen model 6 Risk management 7 References Example ( edit ) For example , a GBPUSD contract could give the owner the right to sell £ 1,000,000 and buy $2,000,000 on December 31 . In this case the pre-agreed exchange rate , or strike price , is 2.0000 USD per GBP ( or GBP / USD 2.00 as it is typically quoted ) and the notional amounts ( notionals ) are £ 1,000,000 and $2,000,000 . This type of contract is both a call on dollars and a put on sterling , and is typically called a GBPUSD put , as it is a put on the exchange rate ; although it could equally be called a USDGBP call . If the rate is lower than 2.0000 on December 31 ( say 1.9000 ) , meaning that the dollar is stronger and the pound is weaker , then the option is exercised , allowing the owner to sell GBP at 2.0000 and immediately buy it back in the spot market at 1.9000 , making a profit of ( 2.0000 GBPUSD − 1.9000 GBPUSD ) × 1,000,000 GBP = 100,000 USD in the process . If instead they take the profit in GBP ( by selling the USD on the spot market ) this amounts to 100,000 / 1.9000 = 52,632 GBP . Terms ( edit ) Call option -- the right to buy an asset at a fixed date and price . Put option -- the right to sell an asset at a fixed date and price . Foreign exchange option -- the right to sell money in one currency and buy money in another currency at a fixed date and rate . Strike price -- the asset price at which the investor can exercise an option . Spot price -- the price of the asset at the time of the trade . Forward price -- the price of the asset for delivery at a future time . Notional -- the amount of each currency that the option allows the investor to sell or buy . Ratio of notionals -- the strike , not the current spot or forward . Numéraire -- the currency in which an asset is valued . Non-linear payoff -- the payoff for a straightforward FX option is linear in the underlying currency , denominating the payout in a given numéraire . Change of numéraire -- the implied volatility of an FX option depends on the numéraire of the purchaser , again because of the non-linearity of x ↦ 1 / x ( \ displaystyle x \ mapsto 1 / x ) . In the money -- for a put option , this is when the current price is less than the strike price , and would thus generate a profit were it exercised ; for a call option the situation is inverted . Trading ( edit ) The difference between FX options and traditional options is that in the latter case the trade is to give an amount of money and receive the right to buy or sell a commodity , stock or other non-money asset . In FX options , the asset in question is also money , denominated in another currency . For example , a call option on oil allows the investor to buy oil at a given price and date . The investor on the other side of the trade is in effect selling a put option on the currency . To eliminate residual risk , match the foreign currency notionals , not the local currency notionals , else the foreign currencies received and delivered do n't offset . In the case of an FX option on a rate , as in the above example , an option on GBPUSD gives a USD value that is linear in GBPUSD using USD as the numéraire ( a move from 2.0000 to 1.9000 yields a . 10 * $2,000,000 / $2.0000 = $100,000 profit ) , but has a non-linear GBP value . Conversely , the GBP value is linear in the USDGBP rate , while the USD value is non-linear . This is because inverting a rate has the effect of x ↦ 1 / x ( \ displaystyle x \ mapsto 1 / x ) , which is non-linear . Hedging ( edit ) Corporations primarily use FX options to hedge uncertain future cash flows in a foreign currency . The general rule is to hedge certain foreign currency cash flows with forwards , and uncertain foreign cash flows with options . Suppose a United Kingdom manufacturing firm expects to be paid US $100,000 for a piece of engineering equipment to be delivered in 90 days . If the GBP strengthens against the US $ over the next 90 days the UK firm loses money , as it will receive less GBP after converting the US $100,000 into GBP . However , if the GBP weakens against the US $ , then the UK firm receives more GBP . This uncertainty exposes the firm to FX risk . Assuming that the cash flow is certain , the firm can enter into a forward contract to deliver the US $100,000 in 90 days time , in exchange for GBP at the current forward rate . This forward contract is free , and , presuming the expected cash arrives , exactly matches the firm 's exposure , perfectly hedging their FX risk . If the cash flow is uncertain , a forward FX contract exposes the firm to FX risk in the opposite direction , in the case that the expected USD cash is not received , typically making an option a better choice . Using options , the UK firm can purchase a GBP call / USD put option ( the right to sell part or all of their expected income for pounds sterling at a predetermined rate ) , which : protects the GBP value that the firm expects in 90 days ' time ( presuming the cash is received ) costs at most the option premium ( unlike a forward , which can have unlimited losses ) yields a profit if the expected cash is not received but FX rates move in its favor Valuation : the Garman -- Kohlhagen model ( edit ) As in the Black -- Scholes model for stock options and the Black model for certain interest rate options , the value of a European option on an FX rate is typically calculated by assuming that the rate follows a log - normal process . In 1983 Garman and Kohlhagen extended the Black -- Scholes model to cope with the presence of two interest rates ( one for each currency ) . Suppose that r d ( \ displaystyle r_ ( d ) ) is the risk - free interest rate to expiry of the domestic currency and r f ( \ displaystyle r_ ( f ) ) is the foreign currency risk - free interest rate ( where domestic currency is the currency in which we obtain the value of the option ; the formula also requires that FX rates -- both strike and current spot be quoted in terms of `` units of domestic currency per unit of foreign currency "

However , he decided not to run again in 2017 , meaning that his term in office ended on 24 July 2017 . Selection process ( edit ) Further information : President of India § Selection process , and Electoral College ( India ) The President of India is indirectly elected by an electoral college consisting of the elected members of both houses of parliament , the elected members of the Legislative assemblies of the 29 states and the elected members of the legislative assemblies of the Union Territories of Delhi and Puducherry . As of 2017 , the electoral college comprises 777 MPs and 4,120 MLAs . The system assigns varying numbers of votes to these electoral college members , such that the total weight of MPs and those of MLAs is roughly equal and that the voting power of states and territories are proportional to their population . Overall the members of the electoral college were eligible to cast 1,098,903 votes , yielding a threshold for a majority of 549,452 votes . The nomination of a candidate for election to the office of the President must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders . The election is held by means of a secret ballot under the single transferable vote system . The manner of election of President is provided by Article 55 of the Constitution . The returning officer for the election was Anoop Mishra , the Secretary General of Lok Sabha . Electoral college partisan composition ( edit ) At the time of the election the NDA coalition itself was short of a majority by about 25,000 votes , but was expected to be able to rely on other parties to breach the small deficit without difficulty .

47,"The octet rule states that in chemical compounds atoms tend to have the electron configuration of a noble gas. This means that atoms will try to achieve a full outer shell of eight electrons by either gaining, losing, or sharing electrons with other atoms. This helps to explain why certain elements form certain types of bonds with each other.","The octet rule is a chemical rule of thumb that reflects observation that atoms of main - group elements tend to combine in such a way that each atom has eight electrons in its valence shell , giving it the same electron configuration as a noble gas . The rule is especially applicable to carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , and the halogens , but also to metals such as sodium or magnesium .",the octet rule states that in chemical compounds atoms tend to have the electron configuration of a,noble gas,"Octet rule - wikipedia Octet rule Jump to : navigation , search The bonding in carbon dioxide ( CO ) : all atoms are surrounded by 8 electrons , fulfilling the octet rule . The octet rule is a chemical rule of thumb that reflects observation that atoms of main - group elements tend to combine in such a way that each atom has eight electrons in its valence shell , giving it the same electron configuration as a noble gas . The rule is especially applicable to carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , and the halogens , but also to metals such as sodium or magnesium . The valence electrons can be counted using a Lewis electron dot diagram as shown at the right for carbon dioxide . The electrons shared by the two atoms in a covalent bond are counted twice , once for each atom . In carbon dioxide each oxygen shares four electrons with the central carbon , two ( shown in red ) from the oxygen itself and two ( shown in black ) from the carbon . All four of these electrons are counted in both the carbon octet and the oxygen octet . Contents ( hide ) 1 Example : sodium chloride 2 History 3 Explanation in quantum theory 4 Exceptions 5 Three - electron bonds 6 Hypervalent molecules 7 See also 8 References Example : sodium chloride ( edit ) Ionic bonding is common between pairs of atoms , where one of the pair is a metal of low electronegativity ( such as sodium ) and the second a nonmetal of high electronegativity ( such as chlorine ) . A chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outer electron shell , the first and second shells being filled with two and eight electrons respectively . The first electron affinity of chlorine ( the energy release when chlorine gains an electron ) is + 328.8 kJ per mole of chlorine atoms . Adding a second electron to chlorine requires energy , energy that can not be recovered by formation of a chemical bond . The result is that chlorine will very often form a compound in which it has eight electrons in its outer shell ( a complete octet ) . A sodium atom has a single electron in its outermost electron shell , the first and second shells again being full with two and eight electrons respectively . To remove this outer electron requires only the first ionization energy , which is + 495.8 kJ per mole of sodium atoms , a small amount of energy . By contrast , the second electron resides in the deeper second electron shell , and the second ionization energy required for its removal is much larger : + 4562.4 kJ per mole . Thus sodium will , in most cases , form a compound in which it has lost a single electron and have a full outer shell of eight electrons , or octet . The energy required to transfer an electron from a sodium atom to a chlorine atom ( the difference of the 1st ionization energy of sodium and the electron affinity of chlorine ) is small : + 495.8 − 328.8 = + 167 kJ mol . This energy is easily offset by the lattice energy of sodium chloride : − 787.3 kJ mol . This completes the explanation of the octet rule in this case . History ( edit ) In the late 19th century it was known that coordination compounds ( formerly called `` molecular compounds "

He played one year of college basketball for the Memphis Tigers before being drafted first overall by his hometown Chicago Bulls in the 2008 NBA draft . After being named the NBA Rookie of the Year , Rose , at age 22 , became the youngest player to win the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 2011 . Rose was born and raised in the Chicago area , and attended Simeon Career Academy . He was highly recruited by NCAA scouts and coaches , eventually choosing to join the University of Memphis under coach John Calipari . Rose led the Memphis Tigers to the most wins in NCAA history ( a 38 -- 2 record ) , their first number one ranking in 25 years , and an appearance in the NCAA championship game . In 2009 , an NCAA investigation revealed that Rose 's SAT scores had been invalidated , and as a result , the NCAA vacated Memphis ' entire 2007 -- 08 season . Rose has struggled with significant knee injuries since his 2010 -- 11 MVP campaign . In the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers , Rose tore his ACL in his left knee . Rose required surgery and was subsequently sidelined for the entire 2012 -- 13 season . Rose returned to play in 2013 -- 14 . However , on November 22 , 2013 , during a regular season game against the Portland Trail Blazers , Rose injured his right meniscus which caused him to miss the remainder of the season . Rose returned once again the following season , but knee injuries continued to riddle him , causing him to miss 30 games . In June 2016 , he was traded to the New York Knicks . After one season with the Knicks , Rose joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in July 2017 , but was traded and subsequently released by the Utah Jazz the following February .

Four of these amendments are still technically open and pending , one is closed and has failed by its own terms , and one is closed and has failed by the terms of the resolution proposing it . Article Five of the United States Constitution detailed the two - step process for amending the nation 's frame of government . Amendments must be properly Proposed and Ratified before becoming operative . This process was designed to strike a balance between the excesses of constant change and inflexibility . An amendment may be proposed and sent to the states for ratification by either : The United States Congress , whenever a two - thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives deem it necessary ; OR A national convention , called by Congress for this purpose , on the application of the legislatures of two - thirds ( currently 34 ) of the states . To become part of the Constitution , an amendment must be ratified by either ( as determined by Congress ) : The legislatures of three - fourths ( currently 38 ) of the states , within the stipulated time period -- if any ; OR State ratifying conventions in three - fourths ( currently 38 ) of the states , within the stipulated time period -- if any . Upon being properly ratified , an amendment becomes an operative addition to the Constitution . Approximately 11,539 proposals to amend the Constitution have been introduced in Congress since 1789 ( as of December 2014 ) . Collectively , members of the House and Senate typically propose around 200 amendments during each two -- year term of Congress . Most , however , never get out of the Congressional committees in which they were proposed , and only a fraction of those that do receive enough support to win Congressional approval to go through the constitutional ratification process . Beginning in the early 20th century , Congress has usually , but not always , stipulated that an amendment must be ratified by the required number of states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states in order to become part of the Constitution .

Health care facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses . 58 % of US community hospitals are non-profit , 21 % are government owned , and 21 % are for - profit . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the United States spent more on health care per capita ( $9,403 ) , and more on health care as percentage of its GDP ( 17.1 % ) , than any other nation in 2014 . In 2013 , 64 % of health spending was paid for by the government , and funded via programs such as Medicare , Medicaid , the Children 's Health Insurance Program , and the Veterans Health Administration . People aged under 67 acquire insurance via their or a family member 's employer , by purchasing health insurance on their own , or are uninsured . Health insurance for public sector employees is primarily provided by the government in its role as employer . The United States life expectancy is of 78.6 years at birth , up from 75.2 years in 1990 , but only ranks 42nd among 224 nations , and 22nd out of the 35 industrialized OECD countries , down from 20th in 1990 . In 2016 and 2017 the life expectancy dropped for the first time since 1993 . Of 17 high - income countries studied by the National Institutes of Health , the United States in 2013 , had the highest or near - highest prevalence of obesity , car accidents , infant mortality , heart and lung disease , sexually transmitted infections , adolescent pregnancies , injuries , and homicides . On average , a U.S. male can be expected to live almost four fewer years than those in the top - ranked country , though notably Americans aged 75 live longer than those who reach that age in other developed nations . A 2014 survey of the healthcare systems of 11 developed countries found that the US healthcare system to be the most expensive and worst - performing in terms of health access , efficiency , and equity . Americans undergo cancer screenings at significantly higher rates than people in other developed countries , and access MRI and CT scans at the highest rate of any OECD nation . Gallup recorded that the uninsured rate among U.S. adults was 11.9 % for the first quarter of 2015 , continuing the decline of the uninsured rate outset by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) . Despite being among the top world economic powers , the US remains the sole industrialized nation in the world without universal health care coverage . Prohibitively high cost is the primary reason Americans give for problems accessing health care . At over 27 million , higher than the entire population of Australia , the number of people without health insurance coverage in the United States is one of the primary concerns raised by advocates of health care reform . Lack of health insurance is associated with increased mortality , about sixty thousand preventable deaths per year , depending on the study . A study done at Harvard Medical School with Cambridge Health Alliance showed that nearly 45,000 annual deaths are associated with a lack of patient health insurance . The study also found that uninsured , working Americans have a risk of death about 40 % higher compared to privately insured working Americans . A 2012 study for the years 2002 -- 2008 found that about 25 % of all senior citizens declared bankruptcy due to medical expenses , and 43 % were forced to mortgage or sell their primary residence . In 2010 , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) became law , providing for major changes in health insurance .

57,"The problem of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) was first discovered in the 1970s. Scientists noticed that CFCs were depleting the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. This led to the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out the production of CFCs.","Since the late 1970s , the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the ozone layer . After the development of his electron capture detector , James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air , finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland . In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973 , Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic , finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected , and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment . The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere . The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974 . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere . Once in the stratosphere , the sun 's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C - Cl bond .",when was the problem of cfc's discovered,"late 1970s, late 1970s, 1974, 1973, 1970s","Chlorofluorocarbon - wikipedia Chlorofluorocarbon Jump to : navigation , search Chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) are fully halogenated paraffin hydrocarbons that contain only carbon , chlorine , and fluorine , produced as volatile derivative of methane , ethane , and propane . They are also commonly known by the DuPont brand name Freon . The most common representative is dichlorodifluoromethane ( R - 12 or Freon - 12 ) . Many CFCs have been widely used as refrigerants , propellants ( in aerosol applications ) , and solvents . Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere , the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol , and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) ( e.g. , R - 410A ) and R - 134a .

Because the fluorine and chlorine atoms differ greatly in size and effective charge from hydrogen and from each other , the methane - derived CFCs deviate from perfect tetrahedral symmetry . The physical properties of CFCs and HCFCs are tunable by changes in the number and identity of the halogen atoms . In general , they are volatile but less so than their parent alkanes . The decreased volatility is attributed to the molecular polarity induced by the halides , which induces intermolecular interactions . Thus , methane boils at − 161 ° C whereas the fluoromethanes boil between − 51.7 ( CF H ) and − 128 ° C ( CF ) . The CFCs have still higher boiling points because the chloride is even more polarizable than fluoride . Because of their polarity , the CFCs are useful solvents , and their boiling points make them suitable as refrigerants . The CFCs are far less flammable than methane , in part because they contain fewer C-H bonds and in part because , in the case of the chlorides and bromides , the released halides quench the free radicals that sustain flames . The densities of CFCs are higher than their corresponding alkanes . In general , the density of these compounds correlates with the number of chlorides . CFCs and HCFCs are usually produced by halogen exchange starting from chlorinated methanes and ethanes . Illustrative is the synthesis of chlorodifluoromethane from chloroform : HCCl + 2 HF → HCF Cl + 2 HCl The brominated derivatives are generated by free - radical reactions of the chlorofluorocarbons , replacing C-H bonds with C - Br bonds . The production of the anesthetic 2 - bromo - 2 - chloro - 1 , 1 , 1 - trifluoroethane ( `` halothane "

75,"The phrase ""Beware the ides of March"" is attributed to the Roman soothsayer, or fortune-teller, named Spurinna. In 44 BC, he warned Julius Caesar to ""beware the ides of March,"" which was the day of his assassination.","In modern times , the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC . Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate . As many as 60 conspirators , led by Brutus and Cassius , were involved . According to Plutarch , a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March . On his way to the Theatre of Pompey , where he would be assassinated , Caesar passed the seer and joked , `` The Ides of March are come '' , implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled , to which the seer replied `` Aye , Caesar ; but not gone . '' This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare 's play Julius Caesar , when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to `` beware the Ides of March .

Instead , they counted back from three fixed points of the month : the Nones ( 5th or 7th , depending on the length of the month ) , the Ides ( 13th or 15th ) , and the Kalends ( 1st of the following month ) . The Ides occurred near the midpoint , on the 13th for most months , but on the 15th for March , May , July , and October . The Ides were supposed to be determined by the full moon , reflecting the lunar origin of the Roman calendar . On the earliest calendar , the Ides of March would have been the first full moon of the new year . Religious observances ( edit ) Panel thought to depict the Mamuralia , from a mosaic of the months in which March is positioned at the beginning of the year ( first half of the 3rd century AD , from El Djem , Tunisia , in Roman Africa ) The Ides of each month were sacred to Jupiter , the Romans ' supreme deity .

82,"The group that officially elects the President of the United States is called the Electoral College. The Electoral College is made up of 538 electors, who are chosen by the states based on their population. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, and the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes is declared the winner of the election.","The election of President and Vice President of the United States is an indirect election in which citizens of the United States who are registered to vote in one of the 50 U.S. states or in Washington , D.C. cast ballots not directly for those offices , but instead for members of the U.S. Electoral College , known as electors . These electors then in turn cast direct votes , known as electoral votes , for President , and for Vice President . The candidate who receives an absolute majority of electoral votes ( at least 270 out of a total of 538 , since the Twenty - Third Amendment granting voting rights to citizens of Washington , D.C. ) is then elected to that office .

The Electoral College and its procedure are established in the U.S. Constitution by Article II , Section 1 , Clauses 2 and 4 ; and the Twelfth Amendment ( which replaced Clause 3 after its ratification in 1804 ) . Under Clause 2 , each of the states casts as many electoral votes as the total number of its Senators and Representatives in Congress , while , per the Twenty - third Amendment ratified in 1961 , Washington , D.C. casts the same number of electoral votes as the least - represented state , which is three . Also under Clause 2 , the manner for choosing electors is determined by each state legislature , not directly by the federal government . Many state legislatures previously selected their electors directly , but over time all of them switched to using the popular vote to help determine electors , which persists today . Once chosen , electors generally cast their electoral votes for the candidate who won the plurality in their state , but at least 21 states do not have provisions that specifically address this behavior ; those who vote in opposition to the plurality are known as `` faithless "

91,"The book Wealth of Nations, written by Adam Smith in 1776, is considered to be the first modern work of economics. It is a comprehensive analysis of the production and distribution of wealth in society. Smith argued that the wealth of a nation is determined by the productivity of its citizens, and that the government should not interfere with the free market. He also proposed the concept of the ""invisible hand,"" which states that individuals acting in their own self-interest can lead to the benefit of society as a whole.","An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations , generally referred to by its shortened title The Wealth of Nations , is the magnum opus of the Scottish economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith .

It found Georgia State to be in a good position to begin a competitive football team , and based its remarks on the location and resources of the university . It estimated that total annual expenses by 2012 would be $3.1 million . On April 15 , 2007 , former Atlanta Falcons head coach Dan Reeves was hired by Georgia State as a consultant . On November 1 , 2007 , the university began discussing the possibility of adding football . It found that total costs would cost between $6.2 million and $33.8 million depending on several different factors , including whether a stadium would be built or a preexisting stadium would be used . On April 17 , 2008 , Georgia State launched its football program . On June 12 , 2008 , former Georgia Tech , Alabama , and Kentucky head coach Bill Curry was named as the Georgia State head coach , working on a 5 - year contract . This was followed by the hiring of John Bond as offensive coordinator , John Thompson as defensive coordinator , and George Pugh as assistant head coach , as well as Chris Ward and Anthony Midget . On November 20 , 2008 , ground was broken for a downtown practice facility at 188 Martin Luther King Drive . The facility would eventually be expanded to include a 100 - yard artificial turf field and a 50 - yard natural turf field . The existing buildings were converted into facilities and offices for the football team . On January 4 , 2009 , Mark Hogan , son of former Georgia Tech player Mark Hogan , Sr. , enrolled to play as wide receiver on scholarship , making him the first football player to receive a scholarship from Georgia State . The following month , the program signed its first recruiting class of 27 players , including the three - star running back Parris Lee . On February 25 , 2009 , Georgia State named Cheryl Levick as athletic director . Levick left leaving Maryland , where she had served as the school 's executive senior athletic director . By June 11 , the CAA announced that they Georgia State was joining the conference and would officially begin CAA play during the 2012 season . The Panthers would n't play football until the 2010 season , and so the 2009 season was spent practicing at an NFL facility in downtown Atlanta . 71 players reported on August 14 . Athletic director Cheryl Levick trades helmets with Sun Belt commissioner Karl Benson at the Georgia Dome on April 9 , 2012 Georgia State 's second recruiting class was signed on February 3 , 2010 . The team would go on to hold spring practice beginning on March 23 , and would begin working out at the new practice facility by March 27 . On September 2 , Georgia State played its first football game and home opener against the Shorter Hawks , winning the game 41 -- 7 . The first touchdown was recorded by Parris Lee . A crowd of 30,237 was present at the Georgia Dome including then Georgia governor Sonny Perdue , former mayor Andrew Young , amongst other dignitaries . Later during the last game of the season on November 18 , Georgia State would play FBS defending national champion and number 10 ranked Alabama in Tuscaloosa , Alabama , losing 63 -- 7 . The single touchdown was earned during a kick return by Albert Wilson . Georgia State would finish its inaugural year with a 6 -- 5 record . During its second year of play , the Panthers would record a 3 -- 8 record . The season would be marked by a constant shuffle of quarterbacks after the 2009 starter Drew Little was suspended for the first four games and the second - string quarterback Kelton Hill was arrested prior to the season opener , leaving the punter , Bo Schlecter as starting quarterback . The 2012 season marked the last with Bill Curry as head coach as he had stated that he would retire after the end of the season . Throughout the season , the Panthers were plagued with inconsistencies on both the offense and defense , made worse by injuries on either side and inexperienced quarterbacks . Curry would end his final season ( and only year in the CAA ) with a 1 -- 10 record . The Panthers were not eligible for a post season berth ( through neither the conference 's automatic bid nor an at large bid ) due to their reclassifying status as the team prepared to move up to FBS football in the Sun Belt Conference . This reclassifying status did allow for the Panthers to use more scholarships than the allowed 63 scholarships at the FCS level . On opening day Matt Hubbard surpassed the NCAA record for highest punting average in a single game , but it would end up not counting in the record books due to the reclassification . Georgia State officially announced that it would join the Sun Belt Conference on April 9 , 2012 , during a press conference at the Georgia Dome . The school began full membership on July 1 , 2013 . Georgia State was a founding member of the Sun Belt Conference in 1976 . The Sun Belt participates in Division I FBS , as opposed to FCS . The Panthers were not eligible for postseason play until the 2014 season . Trent Miles era ( 2013 -- 2016 ) ( edit ) After Coach Bill Curry announced his retirement in August , the administration hired Parker Executive Search to help find potential candidates . On November 30 , the Atlanta Journal - Constitution reported that the university had hired Trent Miles , head coach of Indiana State University . With Trent Miles ' arrival as new head coach came the Panthers first complete change in uniform since the programs inception . The original uniform consisted solely of 2 different outfits ; a blue home jersey with Panthers written across the chest above the player number and two white stripes on each arm ; and a white away jersey with similar stylings , but with Georgia State written across the chest . Only a single helmet existed , blue and with the secondary GSU emblem on it . Both uniforms used the same white pants with panther heads on them . Initially , an anthracite colored helmet with `` Panthers "
96,"The filename extension used for all Java source files is "".java"". This extension is used to indicate that the file contains source code written in the Java programming language. The source code is then compiled into bytecode, which can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).","When the Internet age first arrived , those using Windows systems that were still restricted to 8.3 filename formats had to create web pages with names ending in . HTM , while those using Macintosh or UNIX computers could use the recommended . html filename extension . This also became a problem for programmers experimenting with the Java programming language , since it requires source code files to have the four - letter suffix . java and compiles object code output files with the five - letter . class suffix .",what is the filename extension used for all java source files,.java,"Filename extension - wikipedia Filename extension Jump to : navigation , search This article needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( November 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) A filename extension is an identifier specified as a suffix to the name of a computer file . The extension indicates a characteristic of the file contents or its intended use . A file extension is typically delimited from the filename with a full stop ( period ) , but in some systems it is separated with spaces . Some file systems implement filename extensions as a feature of the file system itself and may limit the length and format of the extension , while others treat filename extensions as part of the filename without special distinction . Contents ( hide ) 1 Usage 2 Improvements 3 Command name issues 4 Security issues 5 Alternatives 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References 9 External links Usage ( EDIT ) Filename extensions may be considered a type of metadata . They are commonly used to imply information about the way data might be stored in the file . The exact definition , giving the criteria for deciding what part of the file name is its extension , belongs to the rules of the specific filesystem used ; usually the extension is the substring which follows the last occurrence , if any , of the dot character ( example : txt is the extension of the filename readme. txt , and html the extension of mysite. index. html ) . On file systems of some mainframe systems such as CMS in VM , VMS , and of PC systems such as CP / M and derivative systems such as MS - DOS , the extension is a separate namespace from the filename . Under Microsoft 's DOS and Windows , extensions such as EXE , COM or BAT indicate that a file is a program executable . In OS / 360 and successors , the part of the dataset name following the last period is treated as an extension by some software , e.g. , TSO EDIT , but it has no special significance to the operating system itself ; the same applies to Unix files in MVS . Filesystems for UNIX - like operating systems do not separate the extension metadata from the rest of the file name . The dot character is just another character in the main filename , and filenames can have multiple extensions , usually representing nested transformations , such as files. tar. gz ( the . tar indicates that the file is a tar archive of one or more files , and the . gz indicates that the tar archive file is compressed with gzip ) . Programs transforming or creating files may add the appropriate extension to names inferred from input file names ( unless explicitly given an output file name ) , but programs reading files usually ignore the information ; it is mostly intended for the human user . It is more common , especially in binary files , for the file itself to contain internal metadata describing its contents . This model generally requires the full filename to be provided in commands , whereas the metadata approach often allows the extension to be omitted . The VFAT , NTFS , and ReFS file systems for Windows also do not separate the extension metadata from the rest of the file name , and allow multiple extensions . With the advent of graphical user interfaces , the issue of file management and interface behavior arose . Microsoft Windows allowed multiple applications to be associated with a given extension , and different actions were available for selecting the required application , such as a context menu offering a choice between viewing , editing or printing the file . The assumption was still that any extension represented a single file type ; there was an unambiguous mapping between extension and icon . The classic Mac OS disposed of filename - based extension metadata entirely ; it used , instead , a distinct file type code to identify the file format . Additionally , a creator code was specified to determine which application would be launched when the file 's icon was double - clicked . macOS , however , uses filename suffixes , as well as type and creator codes , as a consequence of being derived from the UNIX - like NeXTSTEP operating system . Improvements ( EDIT ) The filename extension was originally used to easily determine the file 's generic type . The need to condense a file 's type into three characters frequently led to abbreviated extensions . Examples include using . GFX for graphics files , . TXT for plain text , and . MUS for music . However , because many different software programs have been made that all handle these data types ( and others ) in a variety of ways , filename extensions started to become closely associated with certain products -- even specific product versions . For example , early WordStar files used . WS or . WSn , where n was the program 's version number . Also , filename extensions began to conflict between separate files . One example is . rpm , used for both RPM Package Manager packages and RealPlayer Media files ; others being . qif , shared by DESQview fonts , Quicken financial ledgers , and QuickTime pictures , and . gba , shared between GrabIt scripts and Game Boy Advance ROM images , and . sb used for SmallBasic and Scratch . Some other operating systems such as Multics that used filename extensions generally had much more liberal sizes for filenames . Many allowed full filename lengths of 14 or more characters , and maximum name lengths up to 255 were not uncommon . The file systems in operating systems such as UNIX stored the file name as a single string , not split into base name and extension components , with the `` . "

During a seance , Lorraine is drawn into a vision where she relives the murders . A demonic nun figure appears and lures her to the basement , where she witnesses Ed being impaled before breaking out of the vision . In 1977 , the Hodgson family begins to experience strange occurrences in their home in the London suburb of Enfield . Janet , the second oldest of four children , is seen sleepwalking and conversing in her dreams with an entity in the form of an angry elderly man , who insists that the house is his . Eventually , all the Hodgson siblings and their mother Peggy witness paranormal events occurring right before their eyes , forcing them to seek refuge with their neighbors . When the media attempts to interview the Hodgsons , Janet is possessed by the spirit of the elderly man , Bill Wilkins , who is revealed to have previously lived and died in the house . During the possession , Wilkins states that he enjoys tormenting the family and wants to reclaim his home . As Janet begins to show more signs of demonic possession , the story eventually reaches the Warrens , and their assistance is requested to assist the local church in an investigation to prove whether or not Janet 's possession is a hoax . Lorraine , fearful that her vision of Ed 's death may become reality , warns him not to get too involved in the case , but she reluctantly agrees to travel to London with him . She has yet another vision of the demonic nun in Ed 's study wherein the demon says its name , which Lorraine scribbles in her Bible . While staying at the Hodgson residence , Ed and Lorraine consult with other paranormal investigators , including Maurice Grosse and Anita Gregory , on the legitimacy of the case . They also attempt to communicate with Wilkins ' spirit , hoping to convince him to stop haunting the family . One night , after the Hodgsons witness Janet being possessed , Gregory presents video evidence of Janet purposely wrecking the kitchen as if for a practical joke , thereby discrediting the haunting . Based on this discovery , Ed and Lorraine feel they have no choice but to leave the family on their own but soon discover that the spirit of Wilkins is only a pawn being manipulated by the demonic nun , to haunt Janet and break her will . Lorraine then realizes that her abilities have been blocked by the demonic nun , preventing her from grasping the truth of Janet 's possession . Ed and Lorraine quickly return to the Hodgson residence , only to find Janet being possessed once more and the rest of the Hodgsons locked outside the house . Ed ventures inside the house alone . A lightning strike hits a tree near the house , leaving a jagged stump resembling the object that impaled Ed in Lorraine 's vision . Ed finds Janet standing near the window , ready to leap onto the stump and commit suicide . He manages to grab Janet in time , but finds himself holding onto a curtain that is being torn from its rings by his and Janet 's weight . Lorraine remembers that she wrote the demon 's name -- Valak -- in her Bible . She enters the house and confronts Valak , addressing it by name and successfully condemns it back to Hell . Janet is freed of its possession , and Lorraine pulls her and Ed to safety . After returning home to the United States , Ed adds an item to his and Lorraine 's collection -- `` The Crooked Man "

Gambling has a long legacy in New Jersey , with the state historically being more permissive of gambling than most other states . Until they were banned in 1844 , lotteries were common in New Jersey . They were used to help pay for the military during the French and Indian War and American Revolution , and help finance the construction of Queen 's College ( now Rutgers University ) and the College of New Jersey ( now Princeton University ) . Freehold Raceway is the oldest racetrack in the United States , with horse racing having taken place there informally since the 1830s . The Monmouth County Agricultural Society was formed on December 17 , 1853 , and in 1854 they began holding an annual fair with harness racing at Freehold Raceway Monmouth Park Racetrack opened in 1870 . In 1894 , the New Jersey Legislature banned parimutuel gambling , and in 1897 the voters of New Jersey approved a referendum which amended the state constitution to ban all gambling ( or possibly all commercial gambling ) . Expansion of gambling ( edit ) From 1894 to 1939 , all gambling was theoretically outlawed in New Jersey , but enforcement was spotty , and it is not clear whether social gambling was prohibited . Bookmaking , numbers games , and slot machines were common through the state , many churches and other non-profit organizations openly held bingos , and Freehold Raceway operated without interruption . Racetrack gambling was re-legalized in 1939 . In 1953 , voters approved a referendum to officially allow non-profit organizations to have bingo and raffles . In 1959 , amusement games were re-legalized after a 1957 court decision had declared them to be a form of illegal gambling . In 1970 , 81.5 % of New Jersey voted in favor of a referendum creating the New Jersey Lottery , and in 1975 , New Jersey initiated the Pick - It ( later renamed the Pick - 3 ) , the first legal lottery game in the United States where buyers could pick their own numbers . In 1974 , New Jersey voters voted against legalizing casino gambling statewide , but two years later approved a new referendum which legalized casinos , but restricted them to Atlantic City . At that time , Nevada was the only state with legal casino gambling . Resorts Atlantic City was the first casino to open in 1978 . As part of the state 's budget showdown in 2006 , gambling in Atlantic City 's casinos and at racetracks in the state were forced to close after it was determined that the official monitors from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission were essential and New Jersey law stated that gambling establishments could not legally operate without state oversight . The closures cost the state an estimated $1.3 million in casino revenues in addition to the loss of state taxes collected on casino employee wages . Sports betting ( edit ) In January 2012 , New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed legislation allowing sports betting in New Jersey after it was approved by a 2 - to - 1 margin in a voter referendum held in November 2011 . The law permits any of the state 's 12 casinos and 4 racetracks to offer gambling on professional and college sports , but prohibits them from accepting bets on college events played in New Jersey , or out - of - state games involving New Jersey college teams . The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement subsequently issued regulations for sports betting . The National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) , the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , the National Football League ( NFL ) , the National Hockey League , and Major League Baseball filed a federal lawsuit against New Jersey to prevent sports betting , based on the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 which banned sports betting in all but four states . In February 2013 , United States District Court judge Michael A. Shipp ruled in favor of the athletic leagues , and barred New Jersey from issuing sports betting licenses . The court ruled that under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution , the regulation of gambling and the granting of a grandfather clause to four states is within Congress 's power . In September 2013 , a three - judge panel from the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2 - 1 to uphold Shipp 's decision . Christie said he will appeal the case to the United States Supreme Court . On June 27 , 2017 , the Supreme Court agreed to hear Christie v. NCAA . The Supreme Court will likely hear oral arguments in the fall of 2017 , with a decision in 2018 . Online gambling ( edit ) In January 2011 , the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill sponsored by Raymond Lesniak to allow online gambling by New Jersey residents over the age of 21 . Because the state constitution only allows casino gambling in Atlantic City , the legislation specified that the computer servers operating the online gambling websites must be located at licensed casinos in Atlantic City . The Lesniak bill evaded possible federal prohibitions against online gambling by authorizing the Casino Control Commission to create regulations to ensure that the bets were placed from inside New Jersey . However , Governor Chris Christie vetoed the legislation because of concerns that `` allowing customers to bet through any computer terminal left open the chance of commercial businesses such as nightclubs and cafes becoming gambling hubs around the state "

Highest stadium audience attendance , 103,985 XIV Los Angeles Rams vs. Pittsburgh Steelers Non-occurrences ( edit ) In the history of the Super Bowl , the following firsts have yet to occur : An all - wild card matchup ( teams who failed to win their divisions ) -- Ten wild card teams have won conference titles since the AFL -- NFL merger , but never two in the same season . The closest the NFL has come to having an all - wild card Super Bowl occurred during the 2010 -- 11 NFL playoffs when the New York Jets , a wild card team , reached the AFC Championship Game where they played the Pittsburgh Steelers . The Pittsburgh Steelers beat the New York Jets 24 -- 19 . In the subsequent Super Bowl , the Pittsburgh Steelers faced another wild card team , the Green Bay Packers , who beat them 31 -- 25 . Every Super Bowl has had a first or second seeded team . A shutout -- Every Super Bowl participant to date has scored . In five cases , the offenses have failed to score a touchdown . In four of those cases , the special teams scored the only touchdown : Super Bowl VI : The Miami Dolphins finished with 3 points , the fewest by a single team in a Super Bowl to date ( and the only team to date to fail to score a touchdown ) . Super Bowl VII : The Washington Redskins , after blocking a field goal attempt , returned a fumble on an attempted pass by the Dolphins kicker , Garo Yepremian , for a touchdown and converted the extra point with 2 : 07 remaining in the game . Super Bowl IX : The Minnesota Vikings recovered a blocked punt in the end zone but did not convert the extra point with 10 : 33 left in the game . Super Bowl XXIII : The Cincinnati Bengals scored on a 93 - yard kickoff return with extra point in the third quarter and kicked 3 field goals throughout the game . Super Bowl XXXV : The New York Giants scored on a 97 - yard kickoff return and converted the extra point in the third quarter . A punt return for a touchdown . There have been 3 blocked punts returned for touchdowns , however . Home field advantage ( playing in one 's own home stadium ) -- No team has ever played in a Super Bowl hosted in its home stadium . On two occasions a team has played in a Super Bowl hosted in its metropolitan area but in a different stadium : The Los Angeles Rams played in Super Bowl XIV at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena , which is about 30 miles from their then - home stadium , the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , and the San Francisco 49ers played in Super Bowl XIX at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto , which is about 25 miles south of the former site of their then - home stadium , Candlestick Park , in San Francisco . The Minnesota Vikings are currently the only team to have come within one win of playing in a Super Bowl in their home stadium , as they lost in the NFC Championship Game in 2017 when their home field , U.S. Bank Stadium , was scheduled to host Super Bowl LII . The Vikings , however , would have remained designated as the `` road team "

107,The ashes used in the Ash Wednesday ritual originate from the burning of the previous year's Palm Sunday palms. The ashes are blessed by the priest and then applied to the forehead of the faithful in the sign of the cross. This ritual is a reminder of mortality and a call to repentance and conversion.,"Ashes are ceremonially placed on the heads of Christians on Ash Wednesday , either by being sprinkled over their heads or , in English - speaking countries , more often by being marked on their foreheads as a visible cross . The words ( based on Genesis 3 : 19 ) used traditionally to accompany this gesture are , `` Memento , homo , quia pulvis es , et in pulverem reverteris . '' ( `` Remember , man , that thou art dust , and to dust thou shalt return . '' ) This custom is credited to Pope Gregory I the Great ( c. 540 -- 604 ) . In the 1969 revision of the Roman Rite , an alternative formula ( based on Mark 1 : 15 ) was introduced and given first place `` Repent , and believe in the Gospel '' and the older formula was translated as `` Remember that you are dust , and to dust you shall return . '' The old formula , based on the words spoken to Adam and Eve after their sin , reminds worshippers of their sinfulness and mortality and thus , implicitly , of their need to repent in time . The newer formula makes explicit what was only implicit in the old .",where did the ashes from ash wednesday originate,Pope Gregory I the Great,"Ash Wednesday - wikipedia Ash Wednesday Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the day of fasting .

It has a wider variety of climates than most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa , and it has lower average temperatures than other countries within this range of latitude , like Australia , because much of the interior ( central plateau or Highveld , including Johannesburg ) of South Africa is at higher elevation . Winter temperatures may reach the freezing point at high altitude , but are at their most mild in coastal regions , particularly the Eastern Cape . Cold and warm coastal currents running north - west and north - east respectively account for the difference in climated between west and east coasts . The weather is also influenced by ENSO ( El Hito -- Southern Oscillation ) . South Africa experiences a high degree of sunshine with rainfall about half of the global average , increasing from west to east , and with semi-desert regions in the north - west .

Upon attending South Huntingdon High School in Ruffs Dale , Pennsylvania , she participated in school plays . Jones won the Miss Pittsburgh contest in 1952 . A program featuring Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy at the White House in 1957 Career ( edit ) Early stage career ( edit ) Her first audition was for an open biweekly casting call held by John Fearnley , casting director for Rodgers and Hammerstein and their various musicals . At the time , Jones had never heard of Rodgers and Hammerstein . Fearnley was so impressed , he ran across the street to fetch Richard Rodgers , who was rehearsing with an orchestra for an upcoming musical . Rodgers then called Oscar Hammerstein at home . The two saw great potential in Jones . She became the first and only singer to be put under personal contract with the songwriters . They first cast her in a minor role in South Pacific . For her second Broadway show , Me and Juliet , she started as a chorus girl , and then an understudy for the lead role , earning rave reviews in Chicago . Movie actress of the 1950s and 1960s ( edit ) Jones impressed Rodgers and Hammerstein with her musically trained voice , and she was cast as the female lead in the film adaptation of their hit musical Oklahoma ! in 1955 . Other film musicals quickly followed , including Carousel ( 1956 ) , April Love ( 1957 ) , and The Music Man ( 1962 ) , in which she was often typecast as a wholesome , kind character . However , she won a 1960 Academy Award for her performance in Elmer Gantry portraying a woman corrupted by the title character played by Burt Lancaster . Her character becomes a prostitute who encounters her seducer years later and takes her revenge . The director , Richard Brooks , had originally fought against her being in the movie , but after seeing her first scene , told her she would win an Oscar for her performance .

The series focused on a young widowed mother whose five children form a pop rock group after the entire family painted its signature bus to travel . She was convinced that the combination of music and comedy would be a surefire hit . Jones realized , however , that : The problem with Partridge -- though it was great for me and gave me an opportunity to stay home and raise my kids -- when my agents came to me and presented it to me , they said if you do a series and it becomes a hit show , you will be that character for the rest of your life and your film career will go into the toilet , which is what happened . But I have no regrets . During its first season , it became a hit and was screened in over 70 countries . Within months , Jones and her co-stars were pop culture television icons . Her real - life 20 - year - old stepson David Cassidy , who was an unknown actor at the time , played Shirley Partridge 's eldest son Keith and became a teen idol . The show also spawned a number of albums and singles by The Partridge Family , performed by David Cassidy and Shirley Jones . That same year , `` I Think I Love You "

119,The Great Wall of China was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The wall was constructed to protect the Chinese Empire from the Mongolian tribes of the north.

The walls were built of rammed earth , constructed using forced labour , and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria . Later dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense . The Han ( 202 BC -- 220 AD ) , the Northern Qi ( 550 -- 574 ) , the Sui ( 589 -- 618 ) , and particularly the Ming ( 1369 -- 1644 ) were among those that rebuilt , re-manned , and expanded the Walls , although they rarely followed Qin 's routes . The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west , the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres ( 990 mi ) of new walls , while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall - building efforts . Conversely , the Tang ( 618 -- 907 ) , the Song ( 960 -- 1279 ) , the Yuan ( 1271 -- 1368 ) , and the Qing ( 1644 -- 1911 ) mostly did not build frontier walls , instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy . Although a useful deterrent against raids , at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies , including in 1644 when the Manchu Qing marched through the gates of Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall - building dynasties , the Ming , as rulers of China .

126,The lymphatic vessels located in the small intestine are called lacteals. Lacteals are specialized lymphatic vessels that absorb dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the small intestine and transport them to the bloodstream.,A lacteal is a lymphatic capillary that absorbs dietary fats in the villi of the small intestine .,what is the name of the lymphatic vessels located in the small intestine,"lacteals, lacteals, A lacteal, lacteal","Lacteal - wikipedia Lacteal Jump to : navigation , search Lacteal Transverse section of a villus , from the human intestine .

Dorlands / Elsevier l_01 / 12474659 Anatomical terminology ( edit on Wikidata ) A lacteal is a lymphatic capillary that absorbs dietary fats in the villi of the small intestine . Triglycerides are emulsified by bile and hydrolyzed by the enzyme lipase , resulting in a mixture of fatty acids , di - and monoglycerides . These then pass from the intestinal lumen into the enterocyte , where they are re-esterified to form triacylglycerol . The triacylglycerol is then combined with phospholipids , cholesterol ester , and apolipoprotein B48 to form chylomicrons . These chylomicrons then pass into the lacteals , forming a milky substance known as chyle . The lacteals merge to form larger lymphatic vessels that transport the chyle to the thoracic duct where it is emptied into the bloodstream at the subclavian vein . At this point , the fats are in the bloodstream in the form of chylomicrons . Once in the blood , chylomicrons are subject to delipidation by lipoprotein lipase . Eventually , enough lipid has been lost and additional apolipoproteins gained , that the resulting particle ( now referred to as a chylomicron remnant ) can be taken up by the liver . From the liver , the fat released from chylomicron remnants can be re-exported to the blood as the triglyceride component of very low - density lipoproteins . Very low - density lipoproteins , also subject to delipidation by vascular lipoprotein lipase , delivers fats to tissues throughout the body and , in particular , the released fatty acids can be stored in adipose cells as triglycerides . As triglycerides are lost from very low - density lipoproteins , the lipoprotein particle becomes smaller and denser ( since protein is denser than lipid ) and ultimately becomes low - density lipoproteins . A great deal has been written about low - density lipoproteins because they are thought to be atherogenic . Note that in contrast to any other route of absorption from the small intestine , the lymphatic system avoids first pass metabolism .

134,The Bantu Education Act of 1953 was a South African law that was designed to segregate and control the education of black South Africans. It was part of the apartheid system and was intended to limit the educational opportunities of black South Africans and to ensure that they received an inferior education compared to white South Africans. The Act was repealed in 1979.,"The Bantu Education Act , 1953 ( Act No. 47 of 1953 ; later renamed the Black Education Act , 1953 ) was a South African segregation law which legalised several aspects of the apartheid system . Its major provision was enforcing racially separated educational facilities . Even universities were made `` tribal '' , and all but three missionary schools chose to close down when the government no longer would help support their schools . Very few authorities continued using their own finances to support education for native Africans . In 1959 , this type of education was extended to `` non white '' universities and colleges with the Extension of University Education Act , and the internationally prestigious University College of Fort Hare was taken over by the government and degraded to being part of the Bantu education system . It is often argued that the policy of Bantu ( African ) education was aimed to direct black or non-white youth to the unskilled labour market , although Hendrik Verwoerd , at the time Minister of Native Affairs , claimed that the aim was to solve South Africa 's `` ethnic problems '' by creating complementary economic and political units for different ethnic groups .",what was the purpose of the bantu education act,enforcing racially separated educational facilities,"Bantu education Act , 1953 - wikipedia Bantu education Act , 1953 Jump to : navigation , search Bantu Education Act , 1953 Act to provide for the transfer of the administration and control of native education from the several provincial administrations to the Government of the Union , and for matters incidental thereto .

There was no bishop , and indeed , there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony . The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London .

In Great Britain , these laws were referred to as the Coercive Acts . The acts took away self - governance and historic rights of Massachusetts , triggering outrage and resistance in the Thirteen Colonies . They were key developments in the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775 . Four of the acts were issued in direct response to the Boston Tea Party of December 1773 . The British Parliament hoped these punitive measures would , by making an example of Massachusetts , reverse the trend of colonial resistance to parliamentary authority that had begun with the 1764 Sugar Act . A fifth act , the Quebec Act , enlarged the boundaries of what was then the Province of Quebec and instituted reforms generally favorable to the French Catholic inhabitants of the region ; although unrelated to the other four Acts , it was passed in the same legislative session and seen by the colonists as one of the Intolerable Acts . The Patriots viewed the acts as an arbitrary violation of the rights of Massachusetts , and in September 1774 they organized the First Continental Congress to coordinate a protest .

Parliament believed that these acts , such as the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767 , were legitimate means of having the colonies pay their fair share of the costs of maintaining the British Empire .

It occurred on 25 -- 26 April 1986 in the No. 4 light water graphite moderated reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near the now - abandoned town of Pripyat , in northern Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic , Soviet Union , approximately 104 km ( 65 mi ) north of Kiev . The event occurred during a late - night safety test which simulated a station blackout power - failure , in the course of which safety systems were intentionally turned off . A combination of inherent reactor design flaws and the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the test , eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions . Water flashed into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent open - air graphite fire . This fire produced considerable updrafts for about nine days . These lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere . The estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot fire phase approximately equaled in magnitude the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion . This radioactive material precipitated onto parts of the western USSR and Europe . During the accident , steam - blast effects caused two deaths within the facility ; one immediately after the explosion , and the other , compounded by a lethal dose of radiation . Over the coming days and weeks , 134 servicemen were hospitalized with acute radiation symptoms , of which 28 firemen and employees died in the days - to - months afterward from the effects of acute radiation syndrome ( ARS ) . In addition , approximately fourteen radiation induced cancer deaths among this group of 134 hospitalized survivors , were to follow within the next ten years ( 1996 ) . Among the wider population , an excess of 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were documented as of 2011 . It will take further time and investigation to definitively determine the elevated relative risk of cancer among the surviving employees , those that were initially hospitalized with ARS and the population at large . The Chernobyl accident is considered the most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history , both in terms of cost and casualties . It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level 7 event ( the maximum classification ) on the International Nuclear Event Scale , the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011 . The struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe , together with later decontamination efforts of the surroundings , ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles . The remains of the No. 4 reactor building were enclosed in a large cover which was named the `` Object Shelter "

156,"The ganglion axons forming the optic nerve run to the brain, specifically to the thalamus and the primary visual cortex. The optic nerve is responsible for carrying visual information from the eye to the brain, where it is processed and interpreted.","The optic nerve leaves the orbit ( eye socket ) via the optic canal , running postero - medially towards the optic chiasm , where there is a partial decussation ( crossing ) of fibres from the temporal visual fields ( the nasal hemi - retina ) of both eyes . The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species , and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species . Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex , while other axons terminate in the pretectal nucleus and are involved in reflexive eye movements .

In humans , the optic nerve is derived from optic stalks during the seventh week of development and is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glial cells ; it extends from the optic disc to the optic chiasma and continues as the optic tract to the lateral geniculate nucleus , pretectal nuclei , and superior colliculus . Contents ( hide ) 1 Structure 2 Function 3 Clinical significance 3.1 Disease 4 Regeneration 5 Additional images 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Structure ( edit ) The optic nerve is the second of twelve paired cranial nerves and is technically part of the central nervous system , rather than the peripheral nervous system because it is derived from an out - pouching of the diencephalon ( optic stalks ) during embryonic development . As a consequence , the fibers of the optic nerve are covered with myelin produced by oligodendrocytes , rather than Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system , and are encased within the meninges . Peripheral neuropathies like Guillain -- Barré syndrome do not affect the optic nerve . However , most typically the optic nerve is grouped with the other eleven cranial nerves and considered to be part of the peripheral nervous system . Dissection of Optic Nerve from above showing parts . Courtesy Dr. John B. Selhorst The optic nerve is ensheathed in all three meningeal layers ( dura , arachnoid , and pia mater ) rather than the epineurium , perineurium , and endoneurium found in peripheral nerves . Fiber tracts of the mammalian central nervous system ( as opposed to the peripheral nervous system ) are incapable of regeneration , and , hence , optic nerve damage produces irreversible blindness . The fibres from the retina run along the optic nerve to nine primary visual nuclei in the brain , from which a major relay inputs into the primary visual cortex . A fundus photograph showing the back of the retina . The white circle is the beginning of the optical nerve . The optic nerve is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glial cells . Each human optic nerve contains between 770,000 and 1.7 million nerve fibers , which are axons of the retinal ganglion cells of one retina . In the fovea , which has high acuity , these ganglion cells connect to as few as 5 photoreceptor cells ; in other areas of retina , they connect to many thousand photoreceptors . The optic nerve leaves the orbit ( eye socket ) via the optic canal , running postero - medially towards the optic chiasm , where there is a partial decussation ( crossing ) of fibres from the temporal visual fields ( the nasal hemi - retina ) of both eyes . The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species , and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species . Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex , while other axons terminate in the pretectal nucleus and are involved in reflexive eye movements . Other axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are involved in regulating the sleep - wake cycle . Its diameter increases from about 1.6 mm within the eye to 3.5 mm in the orbit to 4.5 mm within the cranial space . The optic nerve component lengths are 1 mm in the globe , 24 mm in the orbit , 9 mm in the optic canal , and 16 mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm . There , partial decussation occurs , and about 53 % of the fibers cross to form the optic tracts . Most of these fibres terminate in the lateral geniculate body . Based on this anatomy , the optic nerve may be divided in the four parts as indicated in the image at the top of this section ( this view is from above as if you were looking into the orbit after the top of the skull had been removed ) : 1 . the optic head ( which is where it begins in the eyeball ( globe ) with fibers from the retina ; 2 . orbital part ( which is the part within the orbit ) . 3 . intracanicular part ( which is the part within a bony canal known as the optic canal ) ; and , 4 . cranial part ( the part within the cranial cavity , which ends at the optic chiasm ) . From the lateral geniculate body , fibers of the optic radiation pass to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe of the brain . In more specific terms , fibers carrying information from the contralateral superior visual field traverse Meyer 's loop to terminate in the lingual gyrus below the calcarine fissure in the occipital lobe , and fibers carrying information from the contralateral inferior visual field terminate more superiorly , to the cuneus . Function ( edit ) The optic nerve transmits all visual information including brightness perception , color perception and contrast ( visual acuity ) . It also conducts the visual impulses that are responsible for two important neurological reflexes : the light reflex and the accommodation reflex . The light reflex refers to the constriction of both pupils that occurs when light is shone into either eye ; the accommodation reflex refers to the swelling of the lens of eye that occurs when one looks at a near object as in reading ( lens adjusts to near vision ) . The eye 's blind spot is a result of the absence of photoreceptors in the area of the retina where the optic nerve leaves the eye . Clinical significance ( edit ) Disease ( edit ) Main article : List of eye diseases and disorders Damage to the optic nerve typically causes permanent and potentially severe loss of vision , as well as an abnormal pupillary reflex , which is diagnostically important . The type of visual field loss will depend on which portions of the optic nerve were damaged . In general : Damage to the optic nerve anterior to the optic chiasm causes loss of vision in the eye on the same side as the damage . Damage at the optic chiasm typically causes loss of vision laterally in both visual fields ( bitemporal hemianopsia ) . It may occur with large pituitary tumors pituitary adenoma . ( see image on right of Paris seen with bitemporal hemianopsia ) Paris views showing vision with loss of both temporal visual fields Damage to the optic tract , which is behind ( posterior ) to the chiasm , causes loss of the entire visual field from the side opposite the damage ( so if the left optic tract is cut , there is a loss of vision from the entire right visual field ) . Injury to the optic nerve can be the result of congenital or inheritable problems like Leber 's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy , glaucoma , trauma , toxicity , inflammation , ischemia , infection ( very rarely ) , or compression from tumors or aneurysms . By far , the three most common injuries to the optic nerve are from glaucoma , optic neuritis ( especially in those younger than 50 years of age ) , and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy ( usually in those older than 50 ) . Glaucoma is a group of diseases involving loss of retinal ganglion cells causing optic neuropathy in a pattern of peripheral vision loss , initially sparing central vision . Glaucoma is associated with increased intraocular pressure that damages the optic nerve as it exits the eyeball . Although glaucoma does eventually damage the optic nerve , it is primarily a disease of eye not of the nerve . Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve . It is associated with a number of diseases , the most notable one being multiple sclerosis . The patient will likely experience varying vision loss and eye pain . The condition tends to be episodic . Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is commonly known as `` stroke of the optic nerve "

He completed both hat - tricks by dismissing South Africa 's Tommy Ward . Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat - trick : Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble ( two years apart , between the same teams at the same ground ) , Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram ( just over a week apart , in consecutive matches between the same teams ) and English fast bowler Stuart Broad .

Ibuprofen is now one of the most commonly used over-the-counter medications for pain relief.","Ibuprofen was derived from propionic acid by the research arm of Boots Group during the 1960s . Its discovery was the result of research during the 1950s and 1960s to find a safer alternative to aspirin . It was discovered by a team led by Stewart Adams and the patent application was filed in 1961 . Adams initially tested the drug as treatment for his hangover . The drug was launched as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the United Kingdom in 1969 , and in the United States in 1974 . Later , in 1983 and 1984 , it became the first NSAID ( other than aspirin ) to be available over the counter ( OTC ) in these two countries . Dr. Adams was subsequently awarded an OBE in 1987 .

They followed that up by eliminating the St. Louis Blues and Anaheim Ducks , both in six games . Kevin Fiala and Johansen sustained serious leg injuries in the second and third rounds respectively , and both missed the remainder of the playoffs . The Predators were the third different franchise that head coach Peter Laviolette led to the Stanley Cup Finals . He won the Cup with the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006 , and also took the Philadelphia Flyers to the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals . Game summaries ( edit ) Game one ( edit ) May 29 Nashville Predators 3 -- 5 Pittsburgh Penguins PPG Paints Arena Recap Late in the first period of Game 1 , penalties from Nashville forwards Calle Jarnkrok and James Neal gave Pittsburgh a full two - minute 5 - on - 3 power play , and Evgeni Malkin scored to make it 1 -- 0 . Just 1 : 15 later , Conor Sheary scored into an open net after a cross-ice pass from Chris Kunitz caught Nashville 's defense off guard . In the final seconds of the period , a centering pass from Nick Bonino deflected off Mattias Ekholm and into the net to give Pittsburgh a 3 -- 0 lead . Following Bonino 's goal , the Penguins went 37 consecutive minutes without a shot on goal , including the entire second period . The Predators used power play goals from Ryan Ellis and Colton Sissons to make it 3 -- 2 , and Frederick Gaudreau scored immediately following a Penguins power play to tie the game midway through the third . Soon afterwards , Pittsburgh 's first shot since the first period resulted in a Jake Guentzel goal to give Pittsburgh the lead again . Bonino scored again into an empty net to give Pittsburgh Game 1 .

The Penguins tied it late in the period when a Guentzel tip sneaked past Pekka Rinne . After a scoreless second period in which the Predators took twice as many shots as the Penguins , Pittsburgh came out firing in the third , scoring three goals in 3 : 18 . The first was Guentzel 's twelfth of the playoffs , making him the first rookie since Dino Ciccarelli to score twelve times in a single postseason . The next two goals came 15 seconds apart and prompted Predators head coach Peter Laviolette to replace Rinne with backup Juuse Saros . Nashville never cut into the deficit as Pittsburgh took game 2 4 -- 1 .

Nashville challenged for goaltender interference , but the on - ice ruling was upheld . Carl Hagelin added an empty net goal with 15 seconds remaining . During the second period , a quick whistle prevented a Predators scoring chance that almost certainly would have resulted in a goal .

175,"Kudzu was introduced to the United States in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. It was brought over from Japan as an ornamental plant and was later used to help control soil erosion. Unfortunately, it quickly spread and became an invasive species, taking over large areas of land in the southeastern United States.","The kudzu plant was introduced to the United States from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia . Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi . It has been recorded in Nova Scotia , Canada , in Columbus , Ohio , and in all five boroughs of New York City .",when was kudzu introduced to the united states,"1876, 1876, in 1876","Kudzu in the United States - wikipedia Kudzu in the United States Jump to : navigation , search Kudzu smothering trees in Atlanta , Georgia .

It had previously been known as the Professional Players Tournament , the LG Cup and the Grand Prix . During 2006 and 2007 , it was played in a unique round - robin format , more similar to association football and rugby tournaments than the knock - out systems usually played in snooker . The knock - out format returned in 2008 with an FA Cup - style draw . The random draw was abandoned after the 2010 edition . Ding Junhui was the defending champion . Contents ( hide ) 1 History 2 Winners 3 Records 4 Media coverage 5 References History ( edit ) The tournament was created in 1982 as the Professional Players Tournament by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association , in order to provide another ranking event . Ray Reardon beat Jimmy White by 10 frames to 5 in the final to win the first prize of £ 5,000 . In 1984 Rothmans started sponsoring the tournament , changing its name to the Grand Prix , and moved its venue to the Hexagon Theatre in Reading . The tournament has had various sponsors and venues since . Previous sponsors include LG Electronics , who took over in 2001 and changed the tournament 's name to the LG Cup . After LG withdrew their sponsorship , the Grand Prix name was revived for 2004 and was sponsored by totesport . Between 2006 and 2008 the event was sponsored by Royal London Watches . The tournament was played at the Guild hall in 1998 , at the start of the snooker season , until 2005 ( moving once to Telford in 2000 ) . Prize money for 2005 totalled £ 400,000 , with the winner receiving £ 60,000 . In its original form , the tournament had a flatter structure than most tournaments , with the top 32 players all coming in at the last 64 stage ( in other tournaments there are only 16 players left when the players ranked 17 -- 32 come in , and then the 16 winners of those matches face the top 16 ) . These facts made it more common to see surprise results than in most other tournaments , with players such as Dominic Dale , Marco Fu , Euan Henderson and Dave Harold all surprise finalists at the time . A player from outside the top 16 has reached the final roughly half the times the contest has been played . Few of those have become consistent stars , although Stephen Hendry and John Higgins took their first ranking titles in the event . In addition , over the years , many top 16 players were eliminated in the early stages of the contest . Taking the 1996 event as an extreme case , thirteen of the top sixteen seeds failed to reach the quarter final stages , and the semi-finals featured one match between two top 16 players ( Mark Williams and John Parrott ) and another between two unseeded players ( Euan Henderson and Mark Bennett ) ; with Bennett and Henderson respectively winning the first two quarter final matches , a surprise finalist was guaranteed before the quarter finals had been completed . The event moved to Scotland at the A.E.C.C. in Aberdeen for 2006 , and introduced a brand new format . Players were split into groups ( 8 groups of 8 in qualifying , 8 groups of 6 in the final stages ) and played every other player in their group once . The top 2 players progressed ; the last 16 and onwards were played as a straight knock - out . This resulted in several surprise results . Little - known players such as Ben Woollaston , Jamie Jones and Issara Kachaiwong made it through qualifying , while stars such as Graeme Dott , Stephen Hendry and Shaun Murphy failed to clear their groups . The format was slightly tweaked for 2007 , after complaints ( notably from Dennis Taylor ) that the system was too random . Matches increased in length from best - of - 5 to best - of - 7 , to give the better player more chance to win . The main tie - breaker for players level on wins was changed , with frame difference now taking precedence over results between the players who are level on points . Notably , under the 2007 format , 2006 runner - up Jamie Cope would have been eliminated in the groups , as he defeated third - placed Michael Holt but had an inferior frame - difference . The 2007 event saw fewer surprises , although 2006 World Champion Graeme Dott , 1997 World Champion Ken Doherty , defending champion Neil Robertson , seven - time World Champion Stephen Hendry , six - time World Champion Steve Davis , twice World Champion Mark Williams and 2007 World Championship finalist Mark Selby were all eliminated in the groups . The format was not continued for 2008 , due to dwindling ticket sales in the early rounds . For 2008 , the event moved to the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre ( SECC ) in Glasgow . It went back to a knock - out format with no round - robin . The last 16 and beyond however was played using a FA Cup - style draw , rather than automatically pitching higher ranked players ( or their conquerors ) against lower - ranked players . In 2009 , the event was held in Glasgow , but at another venue , the Kelvin Hall . Following Barry Hearn 's takeover of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association , the Grand Prix was reformatted and renamed to World Open .

Within each ventricle is a region of choroid plexus , a network of ependymal cells involved in the production of CSF . The ventricular system is continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord ( from the fourth ventricle ) allowing for the flow of CSF to circulate . All of the ventricular system and the central canal of the spinal cord are lined with ependyma , a specialised form of epithelium .

The system comprises four ventricles : lateral ventricles right and left ( one for each hemisphere ) third ventricle fourth ventricle There are several foramina , openings acting as channels , that connect the ventricles . The interventricular foramina ( also called the foramina of Monro ) connect the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle through which the cerebrospinal fluid can flow . Name From To interventricular foramina ( Monro ) lateral ventricles third ventricle cerebral aqueduct ( Sylvius ) third ventricle fourth ventricle median aperture ( Magendie ) fourth ventricle subarachnoid space via the cisterna magna right and left lateral aperture ( Luschka ) fourth ventricle subarachnoid space via the cistern of great cerebral vein Ventricles ( edit ) 3D rendering of ventricles ( lateral and anterior views ) . The four cavities of the human brain are called ventricles . The two largest are the lateral ventricles in the cerebrum ; the third ventricle is in the diencephalon of the forebrain between the right and left thalamus ; and the fourth ventricle is located at the back of the pons and upper half of the medulla oblongata of the hindbrain . The ventricles are concerned with the production and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid Development ( edit ) The structures of the ventricular system are embryologically derived from the neural canal , the centre of the neural tube . As the part of the primitive neural tube that will develop into the brainstem , the neural canal expands dorsally and laterally , creating the fourth ventricle , whereas the neural canal that does not expand and remains the same at the level of the midbrain superior to the fourth ventricle forms the cerebral aqueduct . The fourth ventricle narrows at the obex ( in the caudal medulla ) , to become the central canal of the spinal cord . In more detail , around the third week of development , the embryo is a three - layered disc . The embryo is covered on the dorsal surface by a layer of cells called ectoderm . In the middle of the dorsal surface of the embryo is a linear structure called the notochord . As the ectoderm proliferates , the notochord is dragged into the middle of the developing embryo . The notochord becomes a canal within the embryo known as the neural canal . As the brain develops , by the fourth week of embryological development several swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal , near where the head will develop . These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system , and are three in number : the prosencephalon , mesencephalon and rhombencephalon . These in turn divide into five sections . As these sections develop around the neural canal , the inner neural canal becomes known as primitive ventricles . These form the ventricular system of the brain : The neural stem cells of the developing brain , principally radial glial cells , line the developing ventricular system in a transient zone called the ventricular zone . The prosencephalon divides into the telencephalon , which forms the cortex of the developed brain , and the diencephalon . The ventricles contained within the telencephalon become the lateral ventricles , and the ventricles within the diencephalon become the third ventricle . The rhombencephalon divides into a metencephalon and myelencephalon . The ventricles contained within the rhombencephalon become the fourth ventricle , and the ventricles contained within the mesencephalon become the aqueduct of Sylvius . Separating the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles is the septum pellucidum : a thin , triangular , vertical membrane which runs as a sheet from the corpus callosum down to the fornix . During the third month of fetal development , a space forms between two septal laminae , known as the cave of septum pellucidum ( CSP ) , which is a marker for fetal neural maldevelopment . During the fifth month of development , the laminae start to close and this closure completes from about three to six months after birth . Fusion of the septal laminae is attributed to rapid development of the alvei of the hippocampus , amygdala , septal nuclei , fornix , corpus callosum and other midline structures . Lack of such limbic development interrupts this posterior - to - anterior fusion , resulting in the continuation of the CSP into adulthood . Function ( edit ) Flow of cerebrospinal fluid ( edit ) MRI showing flow of CSF The cerebrospinal fluid passes out through arachnoid villi into the venous sinuses of the skull . A schematic illustration of the venous sinuses surrounding the brain . The ventricles are filled with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) which bathes and cushions the brain and spinal cord within their bony confines . CSF is produced by modified ependymal cells of the choroid plexus found in all components of the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct and the posterior and anterior horns of the lateral ventricles . CSF flows from the lateral ventricles via the interventricular foramina into the third ventricle , and then the fourth ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct in the brainstem . From the fourth ventricle it can pass into the central canal of the spinal cord or into the subarachnoid cisterns via three small foramina : the central median aperture and the two lateral apertures . The fluid then flows around the superior sagittal sinus to be reabsorbed via the arachnoid granulations ( or arachnoid villi ) into the venous sinuses , after which it passes through the jugular vein and major venous system . CSF within the spinal cord can flow all the way down to the lumbar cistern at the end of the cord around the cauda equina where lumbar punctures are performed . The cerebral aqueduct between the third and fourth ventricles is very small , as are the foramina , which means that they can be easily blocked . Protection of the brain ( edit ) The brain and spinal cord are covered by the meninges , the three protective membranes of the tough dura mater , the arachnoid mater and the pia mater . The cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) within the skull and spine provides further protection and also buoyancy , and is found in the subarachnoid space between the pia mater and the arachnoid mater . The CSF that is produced in the ventricular system is also necessary for chemical stability , and the provision of nutrients needed by the brain . The CSF helps to protect the brain from jolts and knocks to the head and also provides buoyancy and support to the brain against gravity . ( Since the brain and CSF are similar in density , the brain floats in neutral buoyancy , suspended in the CSF . ) This allows the brain to grow in size and weight without resting on the floor of the cranium , which would destroy nervous tissue . Clinical significance ( edit ) The narrowness of the cerebral aqueduct and foramina means that they can become blocked , for example , by blood following a hemorrhagic stroke . As cerebrospinal fluid is continually produced by the choroid plexus within the ventricles , a blockage of outflow leads to increasingly high pressure in the lateral ventricles . As a consequence , this commonly leads in turn to hydrocephalus . Medically one would call this post-haemorrhagic acquired hydrocephalus , but is often referred to colloquially by the layperson as `` water on the brain "

Roy , a pioneer of the Communist movement in India and an advocate of radical democracy . It became an official demand of the Indian National Congress in 1935 , C. Rajagopalachari voiced the demand for a constituent Assembly on 15th November 1939 based on adult franchise , and was accepted by the British in August 1940 . On 8 August 1940 , a statement was made by Viceroy Lord Linlithgow about the expansion of the Governor - General 's Executive Council and the establishment of a War Advisory Council . This offer , known as the August Offer , included giving full weight to minority opinions and allowing Indians to draft their own constitution . Under the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946 , elections were held for the first time for the Constituent Assembly . The Constitution of India was drafted by the Constituent Assembly , and it was implemented under the Cabinet Mission Plan on 16 May 1946 . The members of the Constituent Assembly were elected by the provincial assemblies by a single , transferable - vote system of proportional representation . The total membership of the Constituent Assembly was 389 : 292 were representatives of the states , 93 represented the princely states and four were from the chief commissioner provinces of Delhi , Ajmer - Merwara , Coorg ( Near Madikeri ) and British Baluchistan . The elections for the 296 seats assigned to the British Indian provinces were completed by August 1946 . Congress won 208 seats , and the Muslim League 73 . After this election , the Muslim League refused to cooperate with the Congress , and the political situation deteriorated . Hindu - Muslim riots began , and the Muslim League demanded a separate constituent assembly for Muslims in India . On 3 June 1947 Lord Mountbatten , the last British Governor - General of India , announced his intention to scrap the Cabinet Mission Plan ; this culminated in the Indian Independence Act 1947 and the separate nations of India and Pakistan . The Indian Independence Act was passed on 18 July 1947 and , although it was earlier declared that India would become independent in June 1948 , this event led to independence on 15 August 1947 . The Constituent Assembly ( elected for an undivided India ) met for the first time on 9 December 1946 , reassembling on 14 August 1947 as a sovereign body and successor to the British parliament 's authority in India . As a result of the partition , under the Mountbatten plan a separate constituent assembly was established in Pakistan on 3 June 1947 . The representatives of the areas incorporated into Pakistan ceased to be members of the Constituent Assembly of India . New elections were held for the West Punjab and East Bengal ( which became part of Pakistan , although East Bengal later seceded to become Bangladesh ) ; the membership of the Constituent Assembly was 299 after the reorganization , and it met on 31 December 1947 .

It existed for almost three years , the first parliament of India after independence in 1947 . The Assembly was not elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage , and Muslims and Sikhs received special representation as minorities . The Muslim League boycotted the Assembly after failing to prevent its creation . Although a large part of the Constituent Assembly was drawn from the Congress Party in a one - party environment , the Congress Party included a wide diversity of opinions -- from conservative industrialists and radical Marxists to Hindu revivalists -- all of whom participated in the process . The Assembly met for the first time in New Delhi on 9 December 1946 , and its last session was held on 24 January 1950 . During this period ( two years , eleven months and eighteen days ) the Assembly held eleven sessions , sitting for a total of 166 days . The hope of the Assembly was expressed by Jawaharlal Nehru : The first task of this Assembly is to free India through a new constitution , to feed the starving people , and to clothe the naked masses , and to give every Indian the fullest opportunity to develop himself according to his capacity . This is certainly a great task . Look at India today . We , are sitting here and there in despair in many places , and unrest in many cities . The atmosphere is surcharged with these quarrels and feuds which are called communal disturbances , and unfortunately we sometimes can not avoid them . But at present the greatest and most important question in India is how to solve the problem of the poor and the starving . Wherever we turn , we are confronted with this problem . If we can not solve this problem soon , all our paper constitutions will become useless and purposeless . Keeping this aspect in view , who could suggest to us to postpone and wait ? -- Jawaharlal Nehru , Constituent Assembly Debates ( Proceedings ) , Vol. II Background and election ( edit ) The Constituent Assembly was established while India was still under British rule , following negotiations between Indian leaders and members of the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India from the United Kingdom . Provincial assembly elections were held early in 1946 . Constituent Assembly members were elected indirectly by members of the newly elected provincial assemblies , and initially included representatives for those provinces which formed part of Pakistan ( some of which are now in Bangladesh ) . The Constituent Assembly had 299 representatives , including nine women . The Interim Government of India was formed on 2 September 1946 from the newly elected Constituent Assembly . The Congress held a large majority in the Assembly ( 69 percent of the seats ) , and the Muslim League held nearly all the seats reserved in the Assembly for Muslims . There were also members of smaller parties , such as the Scheduled Caste Federation , the Communist Party of India and the Unionist Party . In June 1947 delegations from Sindh , East Bengal , Baluchistan , West Punjab and the North West Frontier Province withdrew to form the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan , meeting in Karachi . On 15 August 1947 the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan became independent nations , and members of the Constituent Assembly who had not withdrawn to Karachi became India 's Parliament . Twenty - eight members of the Muslim League joined the Indian Assembly , and 93 members were later nominated from the princely states ; the Congress Party secured a majority of 82 percent . Constitution and elections ( edit ) See also : Constitution of India At 11 am on 9 December 1946 the Assembly began its first session , with 208 members attending . By early 1947 , representatives of the Muslim League and princely states joined , and the Assembly approved the draft constitution on 26 November 1949 . On 26 January 1950 the constitution took effect ( commemorated as Republic Day ) , and the Constituent Assembly became the Provisional Parliament of India ( continuing until after the first elections under the new constitution in 1952 ) . Organization ( edit ) Dr. Sachchidananda Sinha was the first chairman ( temporary ) of Constituent Assembly . Later Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected as the president and Its vice-president was Harendra Coomar Mookerjee , a Christian from Bengal and former vice-chancellor of Calcutta University . Also chairing the assembly 's Minorities Committee , Mookerjee was appointed governor of West Bengal after India became a republic . Jurist B.N. Rau was appointed constitutional adviser to the assembly ; Rau prepared the original draft of the constitution , and was later appointed a judge in the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague . The assembly 's work had five stages : Committees presented reports on issues . B.N. Rau prepared an initial draft based on the reports and his research into the constitutions of other nations . The drafting committee , chaired by B.R. Ambedkar , presented a detailed draft constitution which was published for public discussion . The draft constitution was discussed , and amendments proposed and enacted . The constitution was adopted , with a committee of experts led by the Congress Party ( known as the Congress Assembly Party ) played a pivotal role . Timeline ( edit ) 9 December 1946 : The first meeting of the Constituent Assembly was held in the constitution hall ( now the Central Hall of Parliament House ) .

The declaration was due to be signed by all 37 members of Moetzet HaAm . However , twelve members could not attend , eleven of them trapped in besieged Jerusalem and one abroad . The remaining 25 signatories present were called up in alphabetical order to sign , leaving spaces for those absent . Although a space was left for him between the signatures of Eliyahu Dobkin and Meir Vilner , Zerach Warhaftig signed at the top of the next column , leading to speculation that Vilner 's name had been left alone to isolate him , or to stress that even a communist agreed with the declaration . However , Warhaftig later denied this , stating that a space had been left for him ( as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem ) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically , but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father 's memory and so moved down two spaces . He and Vilner would be the last surviving signatories , and remained close for the rest of their lives .

The Israeli Declaration of Independence , formally the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel , was proclaimed on 14 May 1948 ( 5 Iyar 5708 ) by David Ben - Gurion , the Executive Head of the World Zionist Organization and the chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine . It declared the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz - Israel , to be known as the State of Israel , which would come into effect on termination of the British Mandate at midnight that day . The event is celebrated annually in Israel with a national holiday Independence Day on 5 Iyar of every year according to the Hebrew calendar .

The British Foreign Secretary stated in the Balfour Declaration of 1917 : His Majesty 's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people , and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object , it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine , or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country . After World War I , the United Kingdom was given a mandate for Palestine , which it had conquered from the Ottomans during the war . In 1937 the Peel Commission suggested partitioning Mandate Palestine into an Arab state and a Jewish state , though the proposal was rejected as unworkable by the government and was at least partially to blame for the renewal of the 1936 -- 39 Arab revolt . The UN partition plan In the face of increasing violence after World War II , the British handed the issue over to the recently established United Nations . The result was Resolution 181 ( II ) , a plan to partition Palestine into Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem . The Jewish state was to receive around 56 % of the land area of Mandate Palestine , encompassing 82 % of the Jewish population , though it would be separated from Jerusalem . The plan was accepted by most of the Jewish population , but rejected by much of the Arab populace . On 29 November 1947 , the resolution to recommend to the United Kingdom , as the mandatory Power for Palestine , and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation , with regard to the future government of Palestine , of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union was put to a vote in the United Nations General Assembly . The result was 33 to 13 in favour of the resolution , with 10 abstentions . Resolution 181 ( II ) : PART I : Future constitution and government of Palestine : A. TERMINATION OF MANDATE , PARTITION AND INDEPENDENCE : Clause 3 provides : Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem , ... shall come into existence in Palestine two months after the evacuation of the armed forces of the mandatory Power has been completed but in any case not later than 1 October 1948 . The Arab countries ( all of which had opposed the plan ) proposed to query the International Court of Justice on the competence of the General Assembly to partition a country , but the resolution was rejected . Drafting the text The first draft of the declaration was made by Zvi Berenson , the Histadrut trade union 's legal advisor and later a justice of the Supreme Court , at the request of Pinchas Rosen . A revised second draft was made by three lawyers , A. Beham , A. Hintzheimer and Z.E. Baker , and was framed by a committee including David Remez , Pinchas Rosen , Haim - Moshe Shapira , Moshe Sharett and Aharon Zisling . A second committee meeting , which included David Ben - Gurion , Yehuda Leib Maimon , Sharett and Zisling produced the final text . Minhelet HaAm vote On 12 May 1948 , the Minhelet HaAm ( Hebrew : מנהלת העם ‎ , lit . People 's Administration ) was convened to vote on declaring independence . Three of the thirteen members were missing , with Yehuda Leib Maimon and Yitzhak Gruenbaum being blocked in besieged Jerusalem , while Yitzhak - Meir Levin was in the United States . The meeting started at 1 : 45 in the afternoon and ended after midnight . The decision was between accepting the American proposal for a truce , or declaring independence . The latter option was put to a vote , with six of the ten members present supporting it : For : David Ben - Gurion , Moshe Sharett ( Mapai ) ; Peretz Bernstein ( General Zionists ) ; Haim - Moshe Shapira ( Hapoel HaMizrachi ) ; Mordechai Bentov , Aharon Zisling ( Mapam ) . Against : Eliezer Kaplan , David Remez ( Mapai ) ; Pinchas Rosen ( New Aliyah Party ) ; Bechor - Shalom Sheetrit ( Sephardim and Oriental Communities ) . Chaim Weizmann , chairman of the World Zionist Organization and soon to be the first President of Israel , endorsed the decision , after reportedly asking `` What are they waiting for , the idiots ?

207,"The Cornell Method of note taking was developed by Dr. Walter Pauk, an educational psychologist at Cornell University, in the 1950s. The method involves dividing a page into three sections: a cue column, a note-taking column, and a summary section. The cue column is used to jot down key words or phrases, the note-taking column is used to record the main points of the lecture, and the summary section is used to write a brief summary of the lecture.","The Cornell Notes system ( also Cornell note - taking system , Cornell method , or Cornell way ) is a note - taking system devised in the 1940s by Walter Pauk , an education professor at Cornell University .

Pauk advocated its use in his best - selling book How to Study in College . Contents ( hide ) 1 Overview of method 2 Studies on effectiveness 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Overview of method ( edit ) The Cornell method provides a systematic format for condensing and organizing notes . The student divides the paper into two columns : the note - taking column ( usually on the right ) is twice the size of the questions / key word column ( on the left ) . The student should leave five to seven lines , or about two in ( 5 cm ) , at the bottom of the page . Notes from a lecture or teaching are written in the note - taking column ; notes usually consist of the main ideas of the text or lecture , and long ideas are paraphrased . Long sentences are avoided ; symbols or abbreviations are used instead . To assist with future reviews , relevant questions ( which should be recorded as soon as possible so that the lecture and questions will be fresh in the student 's mind ) or key words are written in the key word column . These notes can be taken from any source of information , such as fiction books , DVDs , lectures , text books , etc . Within 24 hours of taking the notes , the student must revise and write questions and then write a brief summary in the bottom five to seven lines of the page . This helps to increase understanding of the topic . When studying for either a test or quiz , the student has a concise but detailed and relevant record of previous classes . When reviewing the material , the student can cover the note - taking ( right ) column while attempting to answer the questions / keywords in the key word or cue ( left ) column . The student is encouraged to reflect on the material and review the notes regularly . Studies on effectiveness ( edit ) A study published in 2010 by Wichita State University compared two note taking methods in a secondary English classroom , and found that Cornell Note taking may be of added benefit in cases where students are required to synthesize and apply learned knowledge , while the guided notes method appeared to be better for basic recall . Cornell format is one of the most frequently suggested note taking format by university websites for student support . However , Cornell notes might be less effective than taking regular notes for certain subjects . Another study published in the summer of 2013 found that `` Students who were taught CN ( Cornell notes ) did take better notes than those who were not , but they did not have higher achievement results .

It is traditionally divided into three areas , from front to back , the : Iris Ciliary body Choroid Function ( edit ) The prime functions of the uveal tract as a unit are : Nutrition and gas exchange : uveal vessels directly perfuse the ciliary body and iris , to support their metabolic needs , and indirectly supply diffusible nutrients to the outer retina , sclera , and lens , which lack any intrinsic blood supply . ( The cornea has no adjacent blood vessels and is oxygenated by direct gas exchange with the environment . ) Light absorption : the uvea improves the contrast of the retinal image by reducing reflected light within the eye ( analogous to the black paint inside a camera ) , and also absorbs outside light transmitted through the sclera , which is not fully opaque . In addition some uveal regions have special functions of great importance , including secretion of the aqueous humour by the ciliary processes , control of accommodation ( focus ) by the ciliary body , and optimisation of retinal illumination by the iris 's control over the pupil . Many of these functions are under the control of the autonomic nervous system . Pharmacology ( edit ) The pupil provides a visible example of the neural feedback control in the body . This is subserved by a balance between the antagonistic sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system . Informal pharmacological experiments have been performed on the pupil for centuries , since the pupil is readily visible , and its size can be readily altered by applying drugs -- even crude plant extracts -- to the cornea . Pharmacological control over pupil size remains an important part of the treatment of some ocular diseases . Drugs can also reduce the metabolically active process of secreting aqueous humour , which is important in treating both acute and chronic glaucoma . Immunology ( edit ) The normal uvea consists of immune competent cells , particularly lymphocytes , and is prone to respond to inflammation by developing lymphocytic infiltrates . A rare disease called sympathetic ophthalmia may represent ' cross-reaction ' between the uveal and retinal antigens ( i.e. , the body 's inability to distinguish between them , with resulting misdirected inflammatory reactions ) .

In practice , like the definition of poverty , the official or common understanding of the poverty line is significantly higher in developed countries than in developing countries . In 2008 , the World Bank came out with a figure ( revised largely due to inflation ) of $1.25 a day at 2005 purchasing - power parity ( PPP ) . In October 2015 , the World Bank updated the international poverty line to $1.90 a day . The new figure of $1.90 is based on ICP purchasing power parity ( PPP ) calculations and represents the international equivalent of what $1.90 could buy in the US in 2011 . The new IPL replaces the $1.25 per day figure , which used 2005 data . Most scholars agree that it better reflects today 's reality , particularly new price levels in developing countries . The common international poverty line has in the past been roughly $1 a day . At present the percentage of the global population living under extreme poverty is likely to fall below 10 % according to the World Bank projections released in 2015 . Determining the poverty line is usually done by finding the total cost of all the essential resources that an average human adult consumes in one year . The largest of these expenses is typically the rent required to live in an apartment , so historically , economists have paid particular attention to the real estate market and housing prices as a strong poverty line affector . Individual factors are often used to account for various circumstances , such as whether one is a parent , elderly , a child , married , etc . The poverty threshold may be adjusted annually .

223,"The football camp featured in the movie Remember the Titans took place at the historic Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

On August 15 , 1971 , the players gather and journey to Gettysburg College , where their training camp takes place . As their days of training camp progress , black and white football team members frequently clash in racially motivated conflicts , including some between captains Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell .

After returning from football camp , Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game , he will be dismissed . Subsequently , the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice , before slowly gaining support from the community .

PREPA is the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico , making it a government monopoly . The authority is ruled by a board of directors appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate . Since 2014 , PREPA is subject to the Puerto Rico Energy Commission , another government agency whose board of directors is also appointed by the governor . Hurricane Maria in September 2017 destroyed PREPAs distribution network , creating a blackout in all parts of the island . On October 25 , 2017 , amidst allegations of improper contracting , the fiscal oversight board established by PROMESA appointed Noel Zamot as interim emergency administrator of the authority . In this role , Zamot will administer the public corporation in its maintenance and expenses . Contents ( hide ) 1 History 1.1 Hurricane Maria 2 Structure 2.1 Board of directors 2.2 Power plants 2.3 Subsidiaries 2.4 Labor unions 3 Finances 4 Gallery 5 References 6 External links History ( edit ) PREPA was originally named the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority ( PRWRA ) -- Spanish : Autoridad de las Fuentes Fluviales ( AFF ) -- which was created by Law No. 83 of May 2 , 1941 during the governorship of Rexford G. Tugwell . Government - owned , PRWRA unified diverse regional and local electric power companies into one unified electric grid . Hurricane Maria ( edit ) This section should include a summary of Whitefish Energy . See Wikipedia : Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article 's main text . ( October 2017 ) When the eye of Hurricane Irma passed north of the island , winds were sufficient to leave 1 million citizens without power . Power had been restored to 980,000 people , when Hurricane Maria struck , leaving nearly the entire island without power . Two weeks later , power had been restored to about 10 % of customers. Full restoration was expected to take months , and many Puerto Ricans bought private generators . Structure ( edit ) Board of directors ( edit ) The board of directors is the governing body of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority . Its membership usually consists of private citizens who are supposed to represent the public interest and may or may not include exofficio political officeholders ( typically the Secretary of Economic Development and Commerce ) . This inconsistency happens as the board 's structure changes whenever a political party gains power , usually every four or eight years . When both the governor and the legislature of Puerto Rico belong to the same party , one of the earliest laws amended by the legislature is the one governing PREPA in order to change its board 's composition . Once a new board is settled in , one of its first resolutions is to appoint a new executive director . These frequent changes effectively make the authority a partisan tool rather than a mere electric utility and , consequently , change the vision , strategy , and plans of the authority every four or eight years according to the political party in power . Of the different members of the board , the governor is usually required to appoint four members with the advice and consent of the Senate . It is through these members , along with the incumbent political officeholders which serve as ex officio , thus the governor and the political party in power effectively control the authority . Three additional members of the board are directly elected by consumers by plurality - at - large ; two of them by residential consumers and one by commercial ones . This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information . ( October 2017 ) The last structural change to the board occurred on June 25 , 2013 after governor Alejandro García Padilla enacted Act 29 of 2013 together with the 17th Legislative Assembly . The act effectively replaced the incumbent board with an entirely new board , as follows : 2013 PREPA Board of Directors Role Representation Name Appointed by García Padilla Remarks Chairman Public interest Harry Rodríguez García Yes Chemical engineer , Vice President and General Manager of Abbott Laboratories Puerto Rico Vice Chairman Elected by consumers Agustín Irizarry Rivera No Professor of electrical engineering at the University of Puerto Rico Secretary Exofficio Miguel Torres Díaz Yes Secretary of Transportation and Public Works At - large Exofficio Alberto Bacó Bagué Yes Secretary of Economic Development and Commerce At - large Public interest Andrés Salas Soler Yes former judge and attorney - at - law At - large Public interest Javier Quintana Méndez Yes Dean of the school of engineering of the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico At - large Elected by consumers Juan Rosario No environmental activist At - large Elected by consumers vacant No At - large Public interest vacant Yes Power plants ( edit ) PREPA serves close to 1.5 million customers through several power plants : Power plant Capacity Energy source Ownership Owner Operator Location AES Ilumina 24 MW solar power private AES Corporation AES Corporation Guayama AES Puerto Rico 454 MW coal private AES Corporation AES Corporation Guayama Aguirre Combined Cycle 592 MW heavy fuel oil publicly owned PREPA PREPA Salinas Aguirre Thermoelectric 900 MW diesel oil publicly owned PREPA PREPA Salinas Cambalache 247 MW diesel oil publicly owned PREPA PREPA Arecibo Costa Sur 990 MW heavy fuel oil publicly owned PREPA PREPA Guayanilla EcoEléctrica 510 MW natural gas private Gas Natural Fenosa , International Power Gas Natural Fenosa Peñuelas Oriana Solar Farm 45 MW ( 58MW ( ) ) solar power private Sonnedix Sonnedix Isabela Palo Seco 602 MW heavy fuel oil publicly owned PREPA PREPA Cataño Punta Lima 26 MW wind power private Sovereign Bank Gestamp Wind Naguabo San Juan Combined Cycle 464 MW diesel oil publicly owned PREPA PREPA San Juan San Juan Thermoelectric 400 MW heavy fuel oil publicly owned PREPA PREPA San Juan San Fermin Solar Farm 26 MW solar power private Uriel Renewables and Coqui Power Uriel Renewables and Coqui Power Loiza Santa Isabel Wind Farm 75 MW wind power private Pattern Energy Pattern Energy Santa Isabel Windmar Ponce 4.5 MW solar power private Windmar Renewable Energy Windmar Renewable Energy Ponce Puerto Rico has 21 hydroelectric plants rated at a combined 156MW . Subsidiaries ( edit ) The public corporation also provides fiber optic broadband to private carriers through one of its subsidiary , PREPA Networks . PREPA is also studying the possibility of selling energy to the United States Virgin Islands with the installation of an underwater power cable between Fajardo and the island of St. Thomas -- similar to the power cable with which it services its clients in Vieques and Culebra , which are also islands . Labor unions ( edit ) There are four labor unions that represent the workers from the authority exclusively UTIER , UITICE , UEPI , and UPAEE . Finances ( edit ) PREPA 's operating expenses for FY2013 denote how fuel purchases take over 58 % of the authority 's operating expenses . As of 2014 the authority carries liabilities of $10.1 billion USD against assets of $6 billion . It also operates with a deficit of about $354 million against revenues of $4.8 billion . In terms of costs , $2.6 billion or about 58 % of PREPA 's expenses are attributed to fuel purchases alone while salaries and collective bargains represent less than 13 % of the authority 's expenses . On May 23 , 2014 , Citigroup severely curtailed PREPA 's line of credit for fuel purchase , forcing PREPA to run out of cash to pay Petrobras , its main oil supplier . Petrobras , in turn , threatened to cut off further shipments to the authority . This forced the authority to take $100 million out of its Capital Improvements Fund in order to pay its debt to Petrobras . PREPA argues that the different agencies of the government of Puerto Rico owe them more than $290 million in debt , while an additional $375 million of revenue is lost through subsidies enacted by the Puerto Rican legislature . An additional $600 million is owed to the authority by residential and commercial consumers , some of them by consumers living in public housing . The authority argues that it would n't have a problem being self - sufficient if it were paid the aforementioned debt and if it were n't forced to give out subsidies . On June 3 , 2014 , senator Ramón Luis Nieves admitted publicly that , `` part of the financial problem at PREPA was provoked by the government and the Puerto Rican legislature . "

232,"The Dust Bowl in Oklahoma officially ended in 1939, after a period of severe dust storms and drought that lasted for nearly a decade. The combination of over-farming, drought, and wind erosion caused the Dust Bowl, which had a devastating effect on the region's economy and environment. The federal government implemented a number of programs to help farmers in the region, including the Soil Conservation Service, which helped to restore the land and prevent further erosion.","The Dust Bowl , also known as the Dirty Thirties , was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s ; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion ( the Aeolian processes ) caused the phenomenon . The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland .",when did the dust bowl end in oklahoma,1940,"Dust Bowl - Wikipedia Dust Bowl Jump to : navigation , search For other uses , see Dust Bowl ( disambiguation ) .

After a frantic chase through the streets of London that ends in St. James 's Park , Roger discovers that Pongo likes Perdy . Her owner , Anita Campbell - Green ( Joely Richardson ) falls in love with Roger when they meet . They both fall into the lake as a result of their dogs chasing each other , but they return to Roger 's home and Anita accepts his proposal . They get married along with Perdita and Pongo . Anita works as a fashion designer at the House of de Vil . Her boss , the pampered and very glamorous Cruella de Vil ( Glenn Close ) , has a deep passion for fur , going so far as to have a taxidermist , Mr Skinner , skin a white tiger at the London Zoo to make it into a rug for her . Anita , inspired by her dalmatian , designs a coat made with spotted fur . Cruella is intrigued by the idea of making garments out of actual dalmatians , and finds it amusing that it would seem as if she was wearing Anita 's dog . Anita soon discovers that Perdy is pregnant and is then informed by Nanny ( Joan Plowright ) that she ( Anita ) is , too , much to her shock . Some time later , Cruella visits their home and expresses contempt upon meeting Roger . Her initial disgust at them having a baby turns to excitement when she finds out Perdy is expecting too . Several weeks later , she returns when a litter of 15 puppies are born and offers Roger and Anita £ 7,500 for them , but they declined her offer . Enraged , Cruella fires Anita and vows revenge against her and Roger . One winter evening , she has her henchmen , Jasper and Horace ( Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams ) break into their home and steal the puppies , while Roger and Anita are walking in the park with Pongo and Perdy . Along with 84 other dalmatians that were previously stolen , they deliver them to her ancient country estate , De Vil Mansion . Cruella also hires Skinner to kill and skin them to create her coat . With the family devastated at the loss of their puppies , Pongo uses the twilight bark to carry the message via the dogs and other animals of Britain , while Roger and Anita notify the Metropolitan Police . A dog who had witnessed the stolen puppies follows Jasper and Horace to the mansion , and finds all of them inside , before helping them escape under the duo 's noses . They make their way to a nearby farm , where they are later joined by Pongo and Perdy . Cruella arrives at the mansion and soon discovers what has happened . Angry with the thieves ' failure , she decides to carry out the job herself , while Jasper and Horace attempt to search for them also . After several mishaps , Jasper and Horace discover nearby police on the hunt for Cruella and her henchmen and hand themselves in , joining Skinner who was beaten earlier while trying to kill Lucky ( one of the 15 puppies ) , who had been left behind .

Shortly afterwards , the fleeing dalmatians ( including Lucky ) are found and sent home via the Suffolk Constabulary , while those looking for Cruella arrive at the farm to arrest her . In the police van , she belittles Jasper , Horace , and Skinner for their incompetence before they are sprayed by a skunk which she had mistaken for her bag .

Perhaps the first was Philolaus ( 470 -- 385 BCE ) , though his system was complicated , including a counter-earth rotating daily about a central fire . A more conventional picture was that supported by Hicetas , Heraclides and Ecphantus in the fourth century BCE who assumed that the earth rotated but did not suggest that the earth revolved about the sun . In the third century BCE , Aristarchus of Samos suggested the sun 's central place . However , Aristotle in the fourth century BCE criticized the ideas of Philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation . He established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about the earth . This was accepted by most of those who came after , in particular Claudius Ptolemy ( 2nd century CE ) , who thought the earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated . In 499 CE , the Indian astronomer Aryabhata wrote that the spherical earth rotates about its axis daily , and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the Earth . He provided the following analogy : `` Just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction , in the same way to a man at Lanka the fixed stars appear to be going westward .

It was while growing up with him that he first got into cars and street racing ( and other sorts of trouble ) . When Brian was only two months out of the Police Academy , his friend Roman Pearce was caught in a garage with eight stolen vehicles . Roman is later sent to jail then afterwards is on probation with an ankle monitor . He blamed Brian for the arrest although he had no knowledge of what had happened in the carjacking incident , but more as a form of betrayal as Brian had joined forces with the police force , an organization he opposed . After learning about Mia 's pregnancy and Dominic 's close relationship with his father , Brian later revealed that he never knew anything about his father since he was never in Brian 's life . Appearances The Fast and the Furious Main article : The Fast and the Furious ( 2001 film ) During the events of the first film , Brian is working as an undercover detective with the LAPD , who assigns him the task of solving a series of semi-trailer truck hijackings . He is given a very short amount of time to find the people responsible before the truckers start arming themselves with shotguns and taking matters into their own hands . Their only lead is a description of the vehicles used , black Honda Civics with green neon underglow . When investigating the street race scene , he then meets Dominic Toretto whose crew he later infiltrates , first as a rival racer , in a race which he loses , then as a member after helping Dom escape the police . While running with Dom , he proceeds to investigate rival race crews led by Johnny Tran ( Rick Yune ) and Hector ( played by Noel Gugliemi ) . He even goes as far as to organize and lead a large SWAT team into Johnny Tran 's house after finding large amounts of merchandise , the kind from the highway robberies , while infiltrating his garage . Although the merchandise is illegal , they find nothing on Tran except a few minor charges -- which leaves only Dom as a suspect . Brian soon finds out Toretto is responsible after watching him suddenly leave in the middle of a party at Race Wars and seeing Mia weeping to herself . He then reveals himself to Mia as a police officer and convinces her that if he does not get to her brother and his crew fast , they could get seriously injured or killed by the truckers who have begun to carry firearms . As Brian and Mia race out to stop Dominic from making another highway robbery , two of his drivers , Letty ( Michelle Rodriguez ) and Vincent , are injured in the process , with Letty rolling her car on the side of the road and Vincent being shot in the side by a shotgun from the truck driver who they tried to hijack . Brian saves Vincent only to reveal to Dom that he 's a cop . Brian later finds Dominic at his house attempting to look for Jesse ( played by Chad Lindberg ) when Tran and his accomplice roll up on their motorbikes pulling a drive by shooting on the Toretto house , narrowly missing everyone there except for Jesse who is killed in the process . Both men then drive after Tran and his accomplice , with Dom running the accomplice of the road while Brian fatally shoots Tran . Afterward he chases Dominic , who he then races resulting in Dominic winning closely just before he is hit by another car . After surviving his car rolling over , Brian later pulls him out of the wreckage only to give him the keys to his vehicle , claiming `` I owe you a ten second car "

243,"The first pencils made with graphite instead of lead were produced in the mid-1800s. The graphite was encased in wood, just like traditional lead pencils, and the pencils were much easier to sharpen and write with. The pencils quickly became popular and replaced lead pencils as the standard for writing and drawing.","As a technique for drawing , the closest predecesor to the pencil was Silverpoint until in 1565 ( some sources say as early as 1500 ) , a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish , Cumbria , England . This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid , and it could easily be sawn into sticks . It remains the only large - scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form . Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead . Consequently , it was called plumbago ( Latin for `` lead ore '' ) . Because the pencil core is still referred to as `` lead '' , or a `` lead '' , many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead , and the black core of pencils is still referred to as lead , even though it never contained the element lead . The words for pencil in German ( bleistift ) , Irish ( peann luaidhe ) , Arabic ( قلم رصاص qalam raṣāṣ ) , and some other languages literally mean lead pen .",when did they replace lead with graphite in pencils,never contained the element lead,"Pencil - wikipedia Pencil Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the writing implement . For other uses , see Pencil ( disambiguation ) . HB graphite pencils Coloured pencils ( Caran d'Ache ) A pencil is a writing implement or art medium constructed of a narrow , solid pigment core inside a protective casing which prevents the core from being broken and / or from leaving marks on the user 's hand during use . Pencils create marks by physical abrasion , leaving behind a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface . They are distinct from pens , which instead disperse a trail of liquid or gel ink that stains the light colour of the paper by absorption . Most pencil cores are made of graphite mixed with a clay binder which leaves grey or black marks that can be easily erased . Graphite pencils are used for both writing and drawing and result in durable markings : though writing is easily removable with an eraser , it is otherwise resistant to moisture , most chemicals , ultraviolet radiation , and natural aging . Other types of pencil core are less widely used , such as charcoal pencils , which are mainly used by artists for drawing and sketching . Coloured pencils are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts , but are typically regarded as art supplies , especially those with waxy core binders that tend to smear on paper instead of erasing . Grease pencils have a softer , crayon - like waxy core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain . The most common type of pencil casing is of thin wood , usually hexagonal in section but sometimes cylindrical , permanently bonded to the core . Similar permanent casings may be constructed of other materials such as plastic or paper . To use the pencil , the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point . Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which are not permanently bonded to the core . Instead , the casing supports a separate , mobile piece of pigment core that can be extended or retracted through the casing tip as needed ; these pencil casings can be re-loaded with a new core ( usually graphite ) when necessary .

The early Volkswagen Beetle and many motorcycles , however , use a cable driven from a front wheel . When the vehicle is in motion , a speedometer gear assembly turns a speedometer cable , which then turns the speedometer mechanism itself . A small permanent magnet affixed to the speedometer cable interacts with a small aluminum cup ( called a speedcup ) attached to the shaft of the pointer on the analogue speedometer instrument . As the magnet rotates near the cup , the changing magnetic field produces eddy currents in the cup , which themselves produce another magnetic field . The effect is that the magnet exerts a torque on the cup , `` dragging "

275,"The discovery of the neutron is credited to British physicist James Chadwick in 1932. Chadwick's discovery of the neutron was a major breakthrough in the field of atomic physics, as it helped to explain the structure of the atom. Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935 for his discovery.","The essential nature of the atomic nucleus was established with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 and the determination that it was a new elementary particle , distinct from the proton .",who is credited with the discovery of the neutron,James Chadwick,"Discovery of the neutron - wikipedia Discovery of the neutron Jump to : navigation , search James Chadwick at the 1933 Solvay Conference . Chadwick had discovered the neutron the year before while working at Cavendish Laboratory . The discovery of the neutron and its properties was central to the extraordinary developments in atomic physics that occurred in the first half of the 20th century . Early in the century , Ernest Rutherford developed a crude model for the atom , based on the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden . In this model , atoms had their mass and positive electric charge concentrated in a very small nucleus . By 1920 chemical isotopes had been discovered , the atomic masses had been determined to be integer multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom , and the atomic number had been identified as the charge on the nucleus . Throughout the 1920s , the nucleus was viewed as composed of combinations of protons and electrons , the two elementary particles known at the time , but that model presented several experimental and theoretical contradictions . The essential nature of the atomic nucleus was established with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 and the determination that it was a new elementary particle , distinct from the proton . The uncharged neutron was immediately exploited as a new means to probe nuclear structure , leading to such discoveries as the creation of new radioactive elements by neutron irradiation ( 1934 ) and the fission of uranium atoms by neutrons ( 1938 ) . The discovery of fission led to the creation of both nuclear power and weapons by the end of World War II . Both the proton and neutron were presumed to be elementary particles until the 1960s when they were determined to be composite particles built from quarks .

In the Rutherford model for the nucleus , red spheres were protons with positive charge and blue spheres were protons tightly bound to an electron with no net charge . The inset shows beta decay of a free neutron as it is understood today ; an electron and antineutrino are created in this process . At the start of the 20th century , the vigorous debate as to the existence of atoms had not yet been resolved . Philosophers such as Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald denied that atoms were real , viewing them as a convenient mathematical construct , while scientists such as Arnold Sommerfeld and Ludwig Boltzmann saw that physical theories required the existence of atoms . Radioactivity had been recently discovered in uranium and thorium . Ernest Rutherford had separated radioactivity into three types : alpha , beta , and gamma rays , depending on their ability to penetrate , or travel into , ordinary objects or gases . These radiations were soon identified with known particles : alpha rays were shown to be helium ions by Rutherford and Thomas Royds in 1907 ; beta rays were shown to be electrons by Henri Becquerel in 1900 ; and gamma rays were shown to be electromagnetic radiation , that is , a form of light , in 1914 . These radiations had also been identified as emanating from atoms , hence they provided clues as to processes occurring within atoms . Conversely , the radiations were also recognized as tools that could be exploited in scattering experiments to probe the interior of atoms . At the University of Manchester between 1908 and 1913 , Rutherford directed Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden in a series of experiments to determine what happens when alpha particles scatter from metal foil . Now called the Rutherford gold foil experiment , or the Geiger -- Marsden experiment , these measurements made the extraordinary discovery that alpha particles would occasionally scatter to high angle when passing through a thin gold foil . The scattering indicated that the alpha particles were reflecting from a small , but dense , component of atoms . Based on these measurements , by 1911 it was apparent to Rutherford that the atom consisted of a small massive nucleus with positive charge surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged electrons . The concentrated atomic mass was required to provide the observed reflection of the alpha particles , and Rutherford developed a mathematical model that accounted for the scattering . The Rutherford model was very influential , motivating the Bohr model for electrons orbiting the nucleus in 1913 and eventually leading to quantum mechanics by the mid-1920s . Discovery of isotopes ( edit ) Concurrent with the work of Rutherford , Geiger , and Marsden , the radiochemist Frederick Soddy at the University of Glasgow was studying radioactive decay chains of uranium . Soddy had been a student of Rutherford . Soddy 's study indicated about 40 different radioactive elements , referred to as radioelements , between uranium and lead , although the periodic table only allowed for 11 elements . By 1913 Soddy had determined that several of these elements had identical chemical properties but different atomic weights . He called these chemically similar elements isotopes . For his study of radioactivity and the discovery of isotopes , Soddy was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Chemistry . Replica of Aston 's third mass spectrometer Building from work by J.J. Thomson on the deflection of positively charged atoms by electric and magnetic fields , Francis Aston built the first mass spectrograph at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1919 . His aim was to try to separate the two isotopes of neon , which he was able to easily do . Aston discovered that the masses of all the particles are whole numbers , called the whole number rule , that is , the masses of all the isotopes are whole number multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom . Aston arbitrarily computed his masses relative to oxygen - 16 , which he took to have a mass of exactly 16 . ( Today the atomic mass unit ( amu ) is relative to carbon - 12 . ) Ironically , the one exception to this rule was hydrogen itself , which had a mass value of 1.008 . The excess mass was small , but well outside experimental uncertainty . Aston and others quickly realized that the discrepancy is due to the binding energy of atoms , that is , the mass of a number of hydrogen atoms bound into a single atom must be less than the sum of the masses of the separate hydrogen atoms . Additional work determined the nuclide binding energies . Aston 's work on isotopes garnered him the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of isotopes in a large number of non-radioactive elements , and for his enunciation of the whole - number rule . Noting Aston 's recent discovery of nuclear binding energy , in 1920 Arthur Eddington suggested that stars may obtain their energy by fusing hydrogen ( protons ) into helium and that the heavier elements may form in stars . Atomic number and Moseley 's law ( edit ) Main article : Moseley 's law Rutherford and others had noted the disparity between the mass of an atom , computed in atomic mass units , and the approximate charge required on the nucleus for the Rutherford model to work . The required charge of the atomic nucleus was usually about half its atomic mass . In 1911 Antonius van den Broek made the then bold suggestion that the required charge , denoted Z , was not half of the atomic weight for elements , but instead was exactly equal to the element 's atomic number , or place in the periodic table . At that time the positions of the elements in the table were not known to have any physical significance , except as a way to order the elements in particular sequences with similar chemical properties . At the University of Manchester in 1913 Henry Moseley discussed the new Bohr model of the atom with the visiting Bohr . The model accounted for the electromagnetic emission spectrum from the hydrogen atom , and Moseley wondered if the electromagnetic emission spectra of heavier elements such as cobalt and nickel would follow their ordering by weight , or by their position in the periodic table . In 1913 - 1914 Moseley tested the question experimentally by using x-ray diffraction techniques . He found that the most intense short - wavelength line in the x-ray spectrum of a particular element , known as the K - alpha line , was related to the element 's position in the periodic table , that is , its atomic number , Z . Indeed , Moseley introduced this nomenclature . Moseley found that the frequencies of the radiation were related in a simple way to the atomic number of the elements for a large number of elements . Within a year it was noted that the equation for the relation , now called Moseley 's law , could be explained in terms of the 1913 Bohr model , with reasonable extra assumptions about atomic structure in other elements . Moseley 's result , by Bohr 's later account , not only established atomic number as a measurable experimental quantity , but gave it a physical meaning as the positive charge on the atomic nucleus . The elements could be ordered in the periodic system in order of atomic number , rather than atomic weight . The result tied together the organization of the periodic table , the Bohr model for the atom , and Rutherford 's model for alpha scattering from nuclei . It was cited by Rutherford , Bohr , and others as a critical advance in understanding the nature of the atomic nucleus . Further research in atomic physics was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Moseley was killed in 1915 at the Battle of Gallipoli , while Rutherford 's student James Chadwick was interned in Germany for the duration of the war , 1914 - 1918 . In Berlin , Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn 's work on determining the radioactive decay chains of radium and uranium by precise chemical separation was interrupted . Meitner spent much of the war working as a radiologist and medical X-ray technician near the Austrian front , while Hahn , a chemist , worked on research in poison gas warfare .

282,"AA on a license plate typically indicates that the vehicle is registered to the state government. This type of license plate is usually used for government-owned vehicles, such as those used by state agencies or law enforcement.","The Netherlands and Portugal both use three groups of two characters ( letters or numbers ) in several sequences : AB - 12 - CD , 12 - 34 - AB , 12 - AB - 34 , AB - 12 - 34 , etc . However , Portuguese plates have a white background , while those of Netherlands ( after 1978 - 01 - 01 ) have a yellow one , though both countries also use white letters on blue plates for classic cars . Furthermore , newer plates on Dutch vehicles only contain consonants , to avoid coincidental abbreviations or words . Also some sensitive letter combinations , such as SS or SD , are not used . The combination ' AA ' is reserved for cars of the royal family . Dutch company registered bus , truck and / or minivan plates always start with a B or a V. Dutch taxis use blue registration plates . The number of new combinations ran out in 2008 . By now , new registered cars in the Netherlands use the following format of two digits - three letters - one digit ( 12 - ABC - 3 ) .",what does aa on a license plate mean,cars of the royal family,"Vehicle registration plates of Europe - wikipedia Vehicle registration plates of Europe Jump to : navigation , search It has been suggested that Vehicle registration plates of the European Union be merged into this article . ( Discuss ) Proposed since June 2017 . This article is about registration plates of Europe . For registration plates of members of the European Union , which share a common format , see Vehicle registration plates of the European Union . The common EU format . ( A denotes Austria ) . Norwegian implementation of a format similar to the EU format . Both formats satisfy the Vienna Convention on road traffic . Turkish implementation of a format similar to the EU format . The circle of stars is removed , but no national symbol is added . A European vehicle registration plate is a vehicle registration plate , a metal or plastic plate or plates attached to a motor vehicle or trailer for official identification purposes . The registration identifier is a numeric or alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies the vehicle within the issuing authority 's database . In Europe most countries have adopted a common format for number plates , such as the common EU format issued in EU member states . This format satisfies the requirements in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic , which states that cross-border vehicles must display a distinguishing code for the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle . This sign may either be an oval sticker placed separately from the registration plate or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate . When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate , it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle , and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state , or the emblem of the regional economic integration organization to which the country belongs .

It was based on a model registration plate which three member states had already introduced before : Ireland ( 1991 ) , Portugal ( 1992 ) and Germany ( 1994 ) . Luxembourg plates had displayed the European Flag on the left part since 1988 . The common design consists of a blue strip on the left side of the plate . This blue strip has the European flag symbol ( twelve yellow stars ) , along with the country code of the member state in which the vehicle is registered . Danish plates have a small holographic strip to the right of the blue EU strip . EU format plates are either white or yellow , on a plate wider than it is tall . Yellow registration plates are used both front and rear in Luxembourg and the Netherlands . In Gibraltar , the United Kingdom and Cyprus , yellow plates are used at the rear and white at the front . The UK use flat plastic plates ( embossed metal plates are an option in the UK ) , as opposed to metal plates in most other European countries . A mixture of plastic or metal plates is permitted in France and Ireland . Plastic plates have earlier also been used in Sweden and Norway Denmark and Hungary use yellow plates for vehicles registered as commercial vehicles and in Greece , Latvia , Lithuania and Sweden yellow plates are used for taxi vehicles . Belgium uses red characters and is the only country not to use the standard black - on - white or black - on - yellow combination ; with the introduction of European - style plates in November 2010 , a slightly darker shade of red was chosen ( RAL 3003 ) to improve legibility . In Norway , cars with front seats only ( used for cargo ) have green plates with black characters . The EU format is optional in Denmark , Finland , the United Kingdom and also Cyprus . This is because of the way in which the Council Regulation implementing the EU Symbol ( Regulation No. 2411 / 98 ) is drafted . It only requires states that have ratified the Vienna Convention of 1968 on road traffic to enforce the EU symbol . Several non-EU European states have implemented similar formats , replacing the circle of stars with own symbols . Norway is an example of such state , issuing europlates with the Norwegian flag replacing the circle of stars . Iceland issues plates with the Icelandic flag above the country code on the left side . From those states that joined in the 2004 enlargement of the European Union Malta already used europlates , while Latvia , Poland and Lithuania had used EU number plates displaying the national flag before their accession , as did Bulgaria and Romania before their accession in 2007 . Turkey is not a member of the EU , however uses the blue European strip on the left of the plate as a member of European Customs Union ( only member of the union without EU membership ) , with the country code ( TR ) , but without the 12 - EU stars sign . License plates consist of letters and digits in combinations of 99 AB 999 , 99 A 9999 , 99 ABC 99 , 99 AB 9999 or 99 A 99999 where the first two digits show which province the vehicle is registered from . First two digits numbers go from 01 to 81 ( as there are 81 provinces in Turkey ) and each one is assigned to a province with alphabetical order e.g. 01 is the code of the province Adana or 34 is the code of the province Istanbul . All 81 provinces uses `` 01 AB 123 "

Advani . This book covers , chronologically , most of all the major and minor events in the life of Advani . My Country My Life presents L.K. Advani 's memoirs in five phases . Phase one - Sindh and India - an unbreakable bond ( 1927 - 47 ) ( edit ) It describes Advani 's early life in Sindh , narrating the heart - rending story of India 's blood - soaked partition into two separate countries -- India and Pakistan -- when Britain 's colonial rule came to an end . He was one of the millions of people who migrated from Pakistan to India -- and also from India to Pakistan . After giving a fascinating socio - spiritual history of Sindh , Advani describes his life at home and school in Karachi ( which he calls his ' favourite city ' ) . He also writes about two transformative influences on his life : the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) , a nationalist organization which he joined as a swayamsevak ( volunteer ) at the age of 14 , and Swami Ranganathananda , head of the Ramakrishna Math in Karachi and an erudite exponent of the philosophy of Swami Vivekananda , whom Advani first met in Karachi . Phase two - journey from Sindh to Rajasthan ( 1947 - 57 ) ( edit ) It deals with Advani 's life as an RSS pracharak ( organiser ) in Rajasthan and as an activist of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh . An important section in this phase deals with the mutually respectful relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and the RSS . Advani convincingly counters the vile propaganda by the Indian Left that the RSS was behind the assassination of the Mahatma in January 1948 . Phase three - entry into National politics ( 1957 - 77 ) ( edit ) It deals with Advani 's evolution as a political leader in New Delhi . ' I was asked , ' he writes , ' by Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya , the main ideologue , guide and organiser of the Jana Sangh , to shift my base to Delhi and work as a political aide to Atal Bihari Vajpayee , who had just been elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time . It is during these two decades that I gained advanced experience in political organisation , political strategy and leadership . ' A particularly riveting section in this phase is the description of the imposition of the draconian Emergency Rule by the then Prime Minister of India , Indira Gandhi , in June 1975 . Along with tens of thousands of pro-democracy leaders and activists belonging to Opposition parties , Advani spent nineteen months in jail . This phase describes , at considerable length , the sad saga of the Emergency and the thrilling tale of the triumph of democracy . It also demonstrates how the then prime minister , Indira Gandhi tried to destroy the basic structure of the Constitution , a wrongdoing which her party , the Indian National Congress , has never honestly debated or apologized for . Phase four - BJP spectacular rise ( 1977 - 97 ) ( edit ) It is the period when Advani emerged as an important national leader . It describes his sterling work in Parliament , and also as the Minister of Information & Broadcasting in the Janata Government ( 1977 -- 79 ) , in dismantling the legal edifice of dictatorship created during the Emergency . It also provides a penetrating account of the disintegration of the Janata Party and the formation of the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . A particularly engaging section of this phase is a narration of the BJP 's active participation in the movement for the reconstruction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya . Advani writes : ' ( It ) soon snowballed into the largest mass movement in the history of independent India . The spectacular public response to my Ram Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya in September -- October 1990 far exceeded my own expectations . Just as the struggle against the Emergency opened my eyes to the Indian people 's unflinching faith in democracy , the Ayodhya movement opened my eyes to the deep - rooted influence of religion in the lives of Hindus of all castes and sects across the country . The phase ends with a captivating narration of another important political campaign in Advani 's life -- the Swarna Jayanti Rath Yatra , which marked the Golden Jubilee of India 's Independence . Phase five - India strong & self confident ( 1997 - 2007 ) ( edit ) It is a period of major accomplishments in Advani 's political career . The BJP 's spectacular rise , since 1989 , culminated in the formation , in March 1998 , of the first truly non-Congress coalition government at the Centre under Atal Bihari Vajpayee 's leadership . After a renewed mandate in 1999 , the government of the BJP - led National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) served the nation with great dedication and distinction for six years . This phase also provides a candid and self - critical assessment of the unanticipated defeat of the NDA in the May 2004 parliamentary elections . ' I have not the slightest doubt , ' Advani says , ' that , as in the past , the BJP will bounce back again . ' The highlights of this part of the book are the Vajpayee government 's determined fight against Pakistan - supported cross-border terrorism fueled by religious extremism , India 's triumph in the Kargil War , the Vajpayee - Advani duo 's efforts to normalise relations with Pakistan , the hopes and frustrations at the Agra Summit between Vajpayee and General Pervez Musharraf , and Advani 's historic journey to Pakistan in June 2005 . About the controversy generated by this visit , he says , ' I have no regrets . ' Reaction ( edit ) Writing in the Hindustan Times , Vir Sanghvi remarks that the book is significant note for what it says , but for what it does n't . He says , `` Advani 's strengths and weaknesses are captured in his new book , My Country My Life , ( Rupa ) . It is a readable , rewarding and often racy account of his political career . Written from the heart , it is part - memoir and part - manifesto "

288,"When an air mass is pushed up and over a mountain range, it is forced to cool and condense as it rises. This causes the air mass to form clouds and precipitation, which can lead to snow or rain depending on the temperature. The air mass is then pushed down the other side of the mountain range, where it warms and dries out, creating a different type of weather system.","Orographic lift occurs when an air mass is forced from a low elevation to a higher elevation as it moves over rising terrain . As the air mass gains altitude it quickly cools down adiabatically , which can raise the relative humidity to 100 % and create clouds and , under the right conditions , precipitation .",what happens when an air mass is pushed up and over a mountain range,Orographic lift,"Orographic lift - wikipedia Orographic lift Jump to : navigation , search A gravity wave cloud pattern -- analogous to a ship wake -- in the downwind zone behind the Île Amsterdam , in the far southern Indian Ocean . The island generates wave motion in the wind passing over it , creating regularly spaced orographic clouds . The wave crests raise and cool the air to form clouds , while the troughs remain too low for cloud formation . Note that while the wave motion is generated by orographic lift , it is not required . In other words , one cloud often forms at the peak . See wave cloud . Orographic lift occurs when an air mass is forced from a low elevation to a higher elevation as it moves over rising terrain .
